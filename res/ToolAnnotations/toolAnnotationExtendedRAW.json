This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The potential effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMFs), such as those emitted by power-lines (in extremely low frequency range), mobile cellular systems and wireless networking devices (in radio frequency range) on human health have been intensively researched and debated. However, how exposure to these EMFs may lead to biological changes underlying possible health effects is still unclear. To reveal EMF-induced molecular changes, unbiased experiments (without a priori focusing on specific biological processes) with sensitive readouts are required. We present the first proteome-wide semi-quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of human fibroblasts, osteosarcomas and mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to three types of non-ionizing EMFs (ELF 50 Hz, UMTS 2.1 GHz and WiFi 5.8 GHz). We performed controlled in vitro EMF exposures of metabolically labeled mammalian cells followed by reliable statistical analyses of differential protein-and pathway-level regulations using an array of established bioinformatics methods. Our results indicate that less than 1% of the quantitated human or mouse proteome responds to the EMFs by small changes in protein abundance. Further network-based analysis of the differentially regulated proteins did not detect significantly perturbed cellular processes or pathways in human and mouse cells in response to ELF, UMTS or WiFi exposure. In conclusion, our extensive bioinformatics analyses of semi-quantitative mass spectrometry data do not support the notion that the short-time exposures to non-ionizing EMFs have a consistent biologically significant bearing on mammalian cells in culture.","title":"Semi-quantitative proteomics of mammalian cells upon short-term exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic fields","authors":[{"name":"Kuzniar A."},{"name":"Laffeber C."},{"name":"Eppink B."},{"name":"Bezstarosti K."},{"name":"Dekkers D."},{"name":"Woelders H."},{"name":"Zwamborn A.P.M."},{"name":"Demmers J."},{"name":"Lebbink J.H.G."},{"name":"Kanaar R."}]},"pmid":"28234898","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC5325209","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170762"},{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.594144"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"SQLite format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3621"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data handling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Differential protein expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3741"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1711-7961","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Arnold Kuzniar","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.esciencecenter.nl","email":"a.kuzniar@esciencecenter.nl","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Roland Kanaar","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.erasmusmc.nl","email":"r.kanaar@erasmusmc.nl","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["arnikz","proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"arnikz","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/arnikz/PIQMIe/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:piqmie","biotoolsID":"piqmie","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-10-16T21:30:19.365396Z","name":"PIQMIe","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Database management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3489"},{"term":"Data visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092"}],"additionDate":"2017-05-16T13:43:40Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://www.research-software.nl/software/piqmie"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"This is a Java-application for the statistical analysis of data from 2-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE).","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Statistical estimate score","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0951"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]},{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[{"term":"JPG","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3579"}]}],"note":"Statistical analysis of 2-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) data.

This paper deals with several data integration and data processing issues that frequently occur within this context. To this end, the data processing workflow within the PROFILE project is presented, a multi-OMICS project that aims on identification of novel biomarkers and the development of new therapeutic targets for seven important liver diseases. Furthermore, a software called CrossPlatformCommander is sketched, which facilitates several steps of the proposed workflow in a semi-automatic manner. Application of the software is presented for the detection of novel biomarkers, their ranking and annotation with existing knowledge using the example of corresponding Transcriptomics and Proteomics data sets obtained from patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, a linear regression analysis of Transcriptomics vs. Proteomics data is presented and its performance assessed. It was shown, that for capturing profound relations between Transcriptomics and Proteomics data, a simple linear regression analysis is not sufficient and implementation and evaluation of alternative statistical approaches are needed. Additionally, the integration of multivariate variable selection and classification approaches is intended for further development of the software. Although this paper focuses only on the combination of data obtained from quantitative Proteomics and Transcriptomics experiments, several approaches and data integration steps are also applicable for other OMICS technologies. Keeping specific restrictions in mind the suggested workflow (or at least parts of it) may be used as a template for similar projects that make use of different high throughput techniques.

Spectral libraries for tandem MS, such as MassBank or NIST, contain reference spectra for many compounds, but their limited chemical coverage reduces the chance for a correct and reliable identification of unknown spectra outside the database domain. On the other hand, compound databases like PubChem or ChemSpider have a much larger coverage of the chemical space, but they cannot be queried with spectral information directly. Recently, computational mass spectrometry methods and in silico fragmentation prediction allow users to search such databases of chemical structures. We present a new strategy called MetFusion to combine identification results from several resources, in particular, from the in silico fragmenter MetFrag with the spectral library MassBank to improve compound identification. We evaluate the performance on a set of 1062 spectra and achieve an improved ranking of the correct compound from rank 28 using MetFrag alone, to rank 7 with MetFusion, even if the correct compound and similar compounds are absent from the spectral library. On the basis of the evaluation, we extrapolate the performance of MetFusion to the KEGG compound database.

This tutorial therefore introduces the Unipept command line interface (http://unipept.ugent.be/clidocs) as a platform-independent tool for such metaproteomics data analyses. First, a detailed overview is given of the available Unipept commands and their functions. Next, the power of the Unipept command line interface is illustrated using two case studies that analyze a single tryptic peptide, and a set of peptides retrieved from a shotgun metaproteomics experiment, respectively.

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: Unipept is an ecosystem of tools developed for fast metaproteomics data-analysis consisting of a web application, a set of web services (application programming interface, API) and a command-line interface (CLI). After the successful introduction of version 4 of the Unipept web application, we here introduce version 2.0 of the API and CLI. Next to the existing taxonomic analysis, version 2.0 of the API and CLI provides access to Unipept's powerful functional analysis for metaproteomics samples. The functional analysis pipeline supports retrieval of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and InterPro entries for the individual peptides in a metaproteomics sample. This paves the way for other applications and developers to integrate these new information sources into their data processing pipelines, which greatly increases insight into the functions performed by the organisms in a specific environment. Both the API and CLI have also been expanded with the ability to render interactive visualizations from a list of taxon ids. These visualizations are automatically made available on a dedicated website and can easily be shared by users. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The API is available at http://api.unipept.ugent.be. Information regarding the CLI can be found at https://unipept.ugent.be/clidocs. Both interfaces are freely available and open-source under the MIT license. CONTACT: pieter.verschaffelt@ugent.be.

The performance of Xilmass was evaluated against the recently published Kojak and the popular pLink algorithms on a calmodulin-plectin complex data set, as well as three additional, published data sets.

knowledge comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Parallelization across multiple computers, a strategy termed distributed computing, can be used to handle this increased complexity; however, setting up and maintaining a distributed computing infrastructure requires resources and skills that are not readily available to most research groups. Here we propose a free and open-source framework named Pladipus that greatly facilitates the establishment of distributed computing networks for proteomics bioinformatics tools. Pladipus is straightforward to install and operate thanks to its user-friendly graphical interface, allowing complex bioinformatics tasks to be run easily on a network instead of a single computer. As a result, any researcher can benefit from the increased computational efficiency provided by distributed computing, hence empowering them to tackle more complex bioinformatics challenges. Notably, it enables any research group to perform large-scale reprocessing of publicly available proteomics data, thus supporting the scientific community in mining these data for novel discoveries.","title":"Pladipus Enables Universal Distributed Computing in Proteomics Bioinformatics","authors":[{"name":"Verheggen K."},{"name":"Maddelein D."},{"name":"Hulstaert N."},{"name":"Martens L."},{"name":"Barsnes H."},{"name":"Vaudel M."}]},"pmid":"26510693","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00850"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data handling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"ugent.be","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Lennart Martens","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"lennart.martens@ugent.be","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools","bits@vib.be"]},"owner":"Katrijn.Vannerum@ugent.be","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/compomics/pladipus"}],"community":null,"version":["0.4.1"],"toolType":["Workbench"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pladipus","biotoolsID":"pladipus","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-08-13T06:31:24Z","name":"Pladipus","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2016-05-17T10:18:27Z","collectionID":["BIG N2N","Proteomics","VIB","Compomics","UGent"],"homepage":"https://github.com/compomics/pladipus"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://expasy.org"}],"description":"The SWISS-MODEL Repository is a database of annotated 3D protein structure models generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline.

Different search engines yield different PSMs and thus different protein lists. Analysis of results from one or multiple search engines is often hampered by different data exchange formats and lack of convenient and intuitive user interfaces. We present PIA, a flexible software suite for combining PSMs from different search engine runs and turning these into consistent results. PIA can be integrated into proteomics data analysis workflows in several ways. A user-friendly graphical user interface can be run either locally or (e.g., for larger core facilities) from a central server. For automated data processing, stand-alone tools are available. PIA implements several established protein inference algorithms and can combine results from different search engines seamlessly. On several benchmark data sets, we show that PIA can identify a larger number of proteins at the same protein FDR when compared to that using inference based on a single search engine. PIA supports the majority of established search engines and data in the mzIdentML standard format.

When no information is known about the interaction between a protein and a peptide, it is of interest to propose candidate sites of interaction at the protein surface, to assist the design of biological experiments to probe the interaction, or to serve as a starting point for more focused in silico approaches. PEP-SiteFinder is a tool that will, given the structure of a protein and the sequence of a peptide, identify protein residues predicted to be at peptide-protein interface. PEP-SiteFinder relies on the 3D de novo generation of peptide conformations given its sequence. These conformations then undergo a fast blind rigid docking on the complete protein surface, and we have found, as the result of a benchmark over 41 complexes, that the best poses overlap to some extent the experimental patch of interaction for close to 90% complexes. In addition, PEP-SiteFinder also returns a propensity index we have found informative about the confidence of the prediction.

All steps rely on a coarse-grained representation of the protein and the peptide. While simple, such a protocol can help to infer useful information, assuming a critical analysis of the results. Moreover, such a protocol can be extended to a semi-flexible protocol where the suboptimal conformations are directly folded in the vicinity of the receptor.","title":"Peptide suboptimal conformation sampling for the prediction of protein-peptide interactions","authors":[{"name":"Lamiable A."},{"name":"Thevenet P."},{"name":"Eustache S."},{"name":"Saladin A."},{"name":"Moroy G."},{"name":"Tuffery P."}]},"pmid":"28236231","type":["Usage"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein-ligand complex","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1461"},"format":[{"term":"PDB","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1460"},"format":[{"term":"PDB","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Ab initio structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0476"},{"term":"Ligand-binding site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3897"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1033-9895","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Pierre Tufféry","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"pierre.tuffery@univ-paris-diderot.fr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"reyjul","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-SiteFinder"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Freeware","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pep-sitefinder","biotoolsID":"pep-sitefinder","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:27Z","name":"PEP-SiteFinder","topic":[{"term":"Protein binding sites","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3534"},{"term":"Molecular modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2275"}],"additionDate":"2017-05-16T13:43:30Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::PEP-SiteFinder"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"https://www.biocatalogue.org/services/3763"}],"description":"High-performance, full-featured text searches across all EMBL-EBI databases or in selected databases available from EMBL-EBI.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":12,"date":"2017-07-03T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"© 2017 The Author(s).We present an update of the EBI Search engine, an easy-to-use fast text search and indexing system with powerful data navigation and retrieval capabilities.

Results: pymzML performs at par with established C programs when it comes to processing times. However, it offers the versatility of a scripting language, while adding unprecedented fast random access to compressed files. Additionally, we designed our compression scheme in such a general way that it can be applied to any field where fast random access to large data blocks in compressed files is desired.

High resolution LC-MS untargeted lipidomics using data independent acquisition (DIA) has the potential to increase lipidome coverage, as it enables the continuous and unbiased acquisition of all eluting ions. However, the loss of the link between the precursor and the product ions combined with the high dimensionality of DIA data sets hinder accurate feature annotation. Here, we present LipidMS, an R package aimed to confidently identify lipid species in untargeted LC-DIA-MS. To this end, LipidMS combines a coelution score, which links precursor and fragment ions with fragmentation and intensity rules. Depending on the MS evidence reached by the identification function survey, LipidMS provides three levels of structural annotations: (i) \"subclass level\", e.g., PG(34:1); (ii) \"fatty acyl level\", e.g., PG(16:0-18:1); and (iii) \"fatty acyl position level\", e.g., PG(16:0/18:1). The comparison of LipidMS with freely available data dependent acquisition (DDA) and DIA identification tools showed that LipidMS provides significantly more accurate and structural informative lipid identifications. Finally, to exemplify the utility of LipidMS, we investigated the lipidomic serum profile of patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a disorder underlying a strong lipid dysregulation. As previously published, a significant decrease in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol esters and an increase in phosphatidylethanolamines were observed in NASH patients. Remarkably, LipidMS allowed the identification of a new set of lipids that may be used for NASH diagnosis. Altogether, LipidMS has been validated as a tool to assist lipid identification in the LC-DIA-MS untargeted analysis of complex biological samples.","title":"LipidMS: An R Package for Lipid Annotation in Untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Data Independent Acquisition-Mass Spectrometry Lipidomics","authors":[{"name":"Alcoriza-Balaguer M.I."},{"name":"Garcia-Canaveras J.C."},{"name":"Lopez A."},{"name":"Conde I."},{"name":"Juan O."},{"name":"Carretero J."},{"name":"Lahoz A."}]},"pmid":"30500173","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03409"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"M Isabel Alcoriza-Balaguer","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"maialba@alumni.uv.es","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":["1.0.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:LipidMS","biotoolsID":"LipidMS","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"LipidMS","topic":[{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Biobank","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3337"}],"additionDate":"2019-05-28T10:56:50Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://cran.r-project.org/package=LipidMS"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/andymlau/Deuteros/issues"}],"description":"Software for rapid analysis and visualization of data from differential hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry.","language":["MATLAB"],"operatingSystem":["Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btz022"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide immunogenicity prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0252"},{"term":"Protein fragment weight comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2929"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Argyris Politis","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"argyris.politis@kcl.ac.uk","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/andymlau/Deuteros/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Deuteros","biotoolsID":"Deuteros","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"Deuteros","topic":[{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-11T08:36:30Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/andymlau/Deuteros"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/yeastrc/proxl-web-app"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/yeastrc/proxl-web-app/issues"},{"note":"web application","type":["Other"],"url":"http://proxl-ms.org/"}],"description":"Platform for the analysis, visualization and sharing of protein cross-linking mass spectrometry data","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"Crux","type":"uses"},{"biotoolsID":"StavroX","type":"uses"},{"biotoolsID":"xQuest","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/yeastrc/proxl-web-app/releases"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":21,"date":"2016-08-05T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"© 2016 American Chemical Society.ProXL is a Web application and accompanying database designed for sharing, visualizing, and analyzing bottom-up protein cross-linking mass spectrometry data with an emphasis on structural analysis and quality control.

Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ubiquitination plays a key role in several human diseases, and recent advances in proteomic technology have spurred interest in identifying ubiquitination sites. However, most current computing tools for predicting target sites are based on small-scale data and shallow machine learning algorithms. Results: As more experimentally validated ubiquitination sites emerge, we need to design a predictor that can identify lysine ubiquitination sites in large-scale proteome data. In this work, we propose a deep learning predictor, DeepUbi, based on convolutional neural networks. Four different features are adopted from the sequences and physicochemical properties. In a 10-fold cross validation, DeepUbi obtains an AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 0.9, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity exceeded 85%. The more comprehensive indicator, MCC, reaches 0.78. We also develop a software package that can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Sunmile/DeepUbi.

Conventional differential expression analysis methods (e.g. student's t-test, ANOVA) focus on assessing mean and variance of biomolecules in each biological group. On the other hand, network-based approaches take into account the interactions between biomolecules in choosing differentially expressed ones. These interactions are typically evaluated by correlation methods that tend to generate over-complicated networks due to many seemingly indirect associations. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package INDEED that allows users to construct a sparse network based on partial correlation, and to identify biomolecules that have significant changes both at individual expression and pairwise interaction levels. We applied INDEED for analysis of two omic datasets acquired in a cancer biomarker discovery study to help rank disease-associated biomolecules. We believe biomolecules selected by INDEED lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting disease status compared to those selected by conventional statistical methods. Also, INDEED's framework is amenable to further expansion to integrate networks from multi-omic studies, thereby allowing selection of reliable disease-associated biomolecules or disease biomarkers.","title":"INDEED: R package for network based differential expression analysis","authors":[{"name":"Li Z."},{"name":"Zuo Y."},{"name":"Xu C."},{"name":"Varghese R.S."},{"name":"Ressom H.W."}]},"pmid":"31179159","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6549230","version":null,"doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621426"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Expression correlation analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3463"},{"term":"Differential protein expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3741"},{"term":"Weighted correlation network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3766"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Zhenzhi Li","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"zzrickli@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact","Maintainer","Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Yiming Zuo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"yimingzuo@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact","Maintainer"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/ressomlab/INDEED/blob/master/vignettes/Introduction_to_INDEED.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:INDEED","biotoolsID":"INDEED","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"INDEED","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Biomarkers","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3360"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-20T12:38:34Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/INDEED.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"R package for filtering of spatially related peaks in mass spectrometry imaging data.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":1,"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"© 2018 The Author(s).

Liquid chromatography (ultraperformance -UPLC and high-performance-HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) is conventionally used to characterize N-glycan structures. Software can automatically assign glycan structures by matching their observed retention times and masses with standardized values in reference databases. However, more precise confirmation of N-glycan structures can be derived using exoglycosidases, enzymes that remove specific monosaccharides from glycans. Exoglycosidase removal of monosaccharides results in signature peak shifts, in both UPLC and MS1, yielding an effective way to verify N-glycan structure with high detail (down to the position and isomeric linkage of each monosaccharide). Because manual interpretation of exoglycosidase data is complex and time consuming, we developed GlycanAnalyzer, a web application that pattern matches N-glycan peak shifts following exoglycosidase digestion and automates structure assignments. GlycanAnalyzer significantly improves assignment accuracy over other auto- A ssignment methods on tests with a monoclonal antibody and four glycan standards (100% versus 82% for the next best software).

However, the fully parametric model can be inflexible, and its R implementation is time-consuming for data sets containing a large number of peptides (e.g., >100000). The new tool built in the C++ language is not only faster in computation time but also equipped with a flexible semiparametric model that handles skewed ratio distributions better. We have also developed a Perseus plugin for EBprotV2 for easy access to the tool.

KGaA, Weinheim.Labeling-based proteomics is a powerful method for detection of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The current data analysis platform typically relies on protein-level ratios, which is obtained by summarizing peptide-level ratios for each protein. In shotgun proteomics, however, some proteins are quantified with more peptides than others, and this reproducibility information is not incorporated into the differential expression (DE) analysis. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic framework EBprot that directly models the peptide-protein hierarchy and rewards the proteins with reproducible evidence of DE over multiple peptides. To evaluate its performance with known DE states, we conducted a simulation study to show that the peptide-level analysis of EBprot provides better receiver-operating characteristic and more accurate estimation of the false discovery rates than the methods based on protein-level ratios. We also demonstrate superior classification performance of peptide-level EBprot analysis in a spike-in dataset. To illustrate the wide applicability of EBprot in different experimental designs, we applied EBprot to a dataset for lung cancer subtype analysis with biological replicates and another dataset for time course phosphoproteome analysis of EGF-stimulated HeLa cells with multiplexed labeling. Through these examples, we show that the peptide-level analysis of EBprot is a robust alternative to the existing statistical methods for the DE analysis of labeling-based quantitative datasets.

Motivation: Many drugs interact with numerous proteins besides their intended therapeutic targets and a substantial portion of these interactions is yet to be elucidated. Protein-Drug Interaction Database (PDID) addresses incompleteness of these data by providing access to putative protein-drug interactions that cover the entire structural human proteome. Results: PDID covers 9652 structures from 3746 proteins and houses 16 800 putative interactions generated from close to 1.1 million accurate, all-atom structure-based predictions for several dozens of popular drugs. The predictions were generated with three modern methods: ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite. They are accompanied by propensity scores that quantify likelihood of interactions and coordinates of the putative location of the binding drugs in the corresponding protein structures. PDID complements the current databases that focus on the curated interactions and the BioDrugScreen database that relies on docking to find putative interactions. Moreover, we also include experimentally curated interactions which are linked to their sources: DrugBank, BindingDB and Protein Data Bank.

Targeted proteomics experiments based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) have gained wide adoption in the use of clinical biomarkers, cellular modeling, and numerous other biological experiments due to their highly accurate and reproducible quantification. The quantitative accuracy in targeted proteomics experiments is reliant on the stable-isotope, heavy-labeled peptide standards that are spiked into a sample and used as a reference when calculating the abundance of endogenous peptides. Therefore, the quality of measurement for these standards is a critical factor in determining whether data acquisition was successful. With improved mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation that enables the monitoring of hundreds of peptides in hundreds to thousands of samples, quality assessment is increasingly important and cannot be performed manually. We present Q4SRM, a software tool that rapidly checks the signal from all heavy-labeled peptides and flags those that fail quality-control metrics. Using four metrics, the tool detects problems with both individual SRM transitions and the collective group of transitions that monitor a single peptide. The program's speed and simplicity enable its use at the point of data acquisition and can be ideally run immediately upon the completion of a liquid chromatography-SRM-MS analysis.","title":"Rapidly Assessing the Quality of Targeted Proteomics Experiments through Monitoring Stable-Isotope Labeled Standards","authors":[{"name":"Gibbons B.C."},{"name":"Fillmore T.L."},{"name":"Gao Y."},{"name":"Moore R.J."},{"name":"Liu T."},{"name":"Nakayasu E.S."},{"name":"Metz T.O."},{"name":"Payne S.H."}]},"pmid":"30525668","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00688"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.pnnl.gov/contacts/feedback.asp","email":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Tutorial material","type":["Training material"],"url":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Q4SRM/wiki/Tutorial"},{"note":null,"type":["Installation instructions"],"url":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Q4SRM/wiki"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:q4srm","biotoolsID":"q4srm","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"Q4SRM","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-01-22T17:27:59Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Q4SRM"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/issues"}],"description":"A standalone tool for extracting data directly from raw files generated by Thermo Orbitrap family instruments.","language":["C#"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/releases"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

In this work, direct extraction and utilization of these data is demonstrated using RawTools, a standalone tool for extracting meta and scan data directly from raw MS files generated on Thermo Orbitrap instruments. RawTools generates summarized and detailed plain text outputs after parsing individual raw files, including scan rates and durations, duty cycle characteristics, precursor and reporter ion quantification, and chromatography performance. RawTools also contains a diagnostic module that includes an optional \"preview\" database search for facilitating informed decision-making related to optimization of MS performance based on a variety of metrics. RawTools has been developed in C# and utilizes the Thermo RawFileReader library and thus can process raw MS files with high speed and high efficiency on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). To demonstrate the utility of RawTools, the extraction of meta and scan data from both individual and large collections of raw MS files was carried out to identify problematic characteristics of instrument performance.

Triggered by Offset, Multiplexed, Accurate mass, High resolution, and Absolute Quantitation (TOMAHAQ) is a recently introduced targeted proteomics method that combines peptide and sample multiplexing. TOMAHAQ assays enable sensitive and accurate multiplexed quantification by implementing an intricate data collection scheme that comprises multiple MS n scans, mass inclusion lists, and data-driven filters. Consequently, manual creation of TOMAHAQ methods can be time-consuming and error prone, while the resulting TOMAHAQ data may not be compatible with common mass spectrometry analysis pipelines. To address these concerns we introduce TomahaqCompanion, an open-source desktop application that enables rapid creation of TOMAHAQ methods and analysis of TOMAHAQ data. Starting from a list of peptide sequences, a user can perform each step of TOMAHAQ assay development including (1) generation of priming run target list, (2) analysis of priming run data, (3) generation of TOMAHAQ method file, and (4) analysis and export of quantitative TOMAHAQ data. We demonstrate the flexibility of TomahaqCompanion by creating a variety of methods testing TOMAHAQ parameters (e.g., number of SPS notches, run length, etc.). Lastly, we analyze an interference sample comprising heavy yeast peptides, a standard human peptide mixture, TMT11-plex, and super heavy TMT (shTMT) isobaric labels to demonstrate ∼10-200 attomol limit of quantification within a complex background using TOMAHAQ.","title":"TomahaqCompanion: A Tool for the Creation and Analysis of Isobaric Label Based Multiplexed Targeted Assays","authors":[{"name":"Rose C.M."},{"name":"Erickson B.K."},{"name":"Schweppe D.K."},{"name":"Viner R."},{"name":"Choi J."},{"name":"Rogers J."},{"name":"Bomgarden R."},{"name":"Gygi S.P."},{"name":"Kirkpatrick D.S."}]},"pmid":"30501201","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":"1.0.2","doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00767"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[]}],"note":"TomahaqCompanion outputs isobaric label based multiplexed targeted assays in a form readable by the mass spectrometer control software.","input":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence (raw)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2974"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Design","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2430"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://github.com/CMRose3355/TomahaqCompanionProgram/tree/master/StarterKit"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.2"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tomahaqcompanion","biotoolsID":"tomahaqcompanion","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"TomahaqCompanion","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-01-23T11:26:01Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/CMRose3355/TomahaqCompanionProgram"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/LFAQ/LFAQ/issues"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/LFAQ/LFAQ"}],"description":"Algorithm for label-free absolute protein quantification, which can correct the biased MS intensities using the predicted peptide quantitative factors for all identified peptides.","language":["R","C++"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/LFAQ/LFAQ/releases"},{"note":null,"type":"Binaries","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/LFAQ/LFAQ/tree/master/ExecutableFiles"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","journal":"Analytical Chemistry","abstract":"© 2018 American Chemical Society. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a predominant choice for large-scale absolute protein quantification, but its quantification accuracy still has substantial room for improvement. A crucial issue is the bias between the peptide MS intensity and the actual peptide abundance, i.e., the fact that peptides with equal abundance may have different MS intensities. This bias is mainly caused by the diverse physicochemical properties of peptides. Here, we propose an algorithm for label-free absolute protein quantification, LFAQ, which can correct the biased MS intensities by using the predicted peptide quantitative factors for all identified peptides. When validated on data sets produced by different MS instruments and data acquisition modes, LFAQ presented accuracy and precision superior to those of existing methods. In particular, it reduced the quantification error by an average of 46% for low-abundance proteins. The advantages of LFAQ were further confirmed using the data from published papers.","title":"LFAQ: Toward Unbiased Label-Free Absolute Protein Quantification by Predicting Peptide Quantitative Factors","authors":[{"name":"Chang C."},{"name":"Gao Z."},{"name":"Ying W."},{"name":"Fu Y."},{"name":"Zhao Y."},{"name":"Wu S."},{"name":"Li M."},{"name":"Wang G."},{"name":"Qian X."},{"name":"Zhu Y."},{"name":"He F."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03267"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Label-free quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3634"},{"term":"Protein fragment weight comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2929"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Cheng Chang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"1987ccpacer@163.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Zhiqiang Gao","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"gaozhiqiang13@mails.ucas.ac.cn","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Tutorial material","type":["Training material"],"url":"https://github.com/LFAQ/LFAQ/blob/master/User%20Guide%20for%20LFAQ.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:LFAQ","biotoolsID":"LFAQ","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"LFAQ","topic":[{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-11T07:34:59Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://lfaq.github.io/LFAQ/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/jchiquet/multivarNetwork/issues"}],"description":"R package for inferring multi-variate/multi-attribute Gaussian graphical models.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","abstract":"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.This chapter addresses the problem of reconstructing regulatory networks in molecular biology by integrating multiple sources of data. We consider data sets measured from diverse technologies all related to the same set of variables and individuals. This situation is becoming more and more common in molecular biology, for instance, when both proteomic and transcriptomic data related to the same set of \u201cgenes\u201d are available on a given cohort of patients. To infer a consensus network that integrates both proteomic and transcriptomic data, we introduce a multivariate extension of Gaussian graphical models (GGM), which we refer to as multiattribute GGM. Indeed, the GGM framework offers a good proxy for modeling direct links between biological entities. We perform the inference of our multivariate GGM with a neighborhood selection procedure that operates at a multiscale level. This procedure employs a group-Lasso penalty in order to select interactions which operate both at the proteomic and at the transcriptomic level between two genes. We end up with a consensus network embedding information shared at multiple scales of the cell. We illustrate this method on two breast cancer data sets.

To date, much effort has been made to understand the mechanisms underlying peptide detection in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based shotgun proteomics and to predict proteotypic peptides in the absence of experimental LC-MS/MS data. However, the prediction accuracy of existing tools is still unsatisfactory. We find that one crucial reason is their neglect of the significant influence of protein proteolytic digestion on peptide detectability in shotgun proteomics. Here, we present an Advanced Proteotypic Peptide Predictor (AP3), which explicitly takes peptide digestibility into account for the prediction of proteotypic peptides. Specifically, peptide digestibility is first predicted for each peptide and then incorporated as a feature into the peptide detectability prediction model. Our results demonstrated that peptide digestibility is the most important feature for the accurate prediction of proteotypic peptides in our model. Compared with the existing available algorithms, AP3 showed 10.3-34.7% higher prediction accuracy. On a targeted proteomics data set, AP3 accurately predicted the proteotypic peptides for proteins of interest, showing great potential for assisting the design of targeted proteomics experiments.","title":"AP3: An Advanced Proteotypic Peptide Predictor for Targeted Proteomics by Incorporating Peptide Digestibility","authors":[{"name":"Gao Z."},{"name":"Chang C."},{"name":"Yang J."},{"name":"Zhu Y."},{"name":"Fu Y."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02520"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide immunogenicity prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0252"},{"term":"Protein signal peptide detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0418"},{"term":"Protein fragment weight comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2929"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Zhiqiang Gao","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"gao_zhi_qiang@126.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Cheng Chang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"changchengbio@163.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge (with restrictions)","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://fugroup.amss.ac.cn/software/AP3/AP3_files/User%20Guide%20of%20AP3.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:AP3","biotoolsID":"AP3","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"AP3","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-11T07:44:13Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://fugroup.amss.ac.cn/software/AP3/AP3.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Tool for extracting comprehensive protein-protein interaction information.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

There is a strong need for a tool that can assist researchers in extracting comprehensive PPI information through literature curation, which is critical in research on protein, for example, construction of protein interaction network, identification of protein signaling pathway, and discovery of meaningful protein interaction. However, most of current tools can only extract PPI relations. None of them are capable of extracting other important PPI information, such as interaction directions, effects, and functional annotations. To address these issues, this paper proposes PPICurator, a novel tool for extracting comprehensive PPI information with a variety of logic and syntax features based on a new support vector machine classifier. PPICurator provides a friendly web-based user interface. It is a platform that automates the extraction of comprehensive PPI information through literature, including PPI relations, as well as their confidential scores, interaction directions, effects, and functional annotations. Thus, PPICurator is more comprehensive than state-of-the-art tools.

While lipids diverse biological roles contribute to their clinical utility, the diversity of lipid structure and concentrations prove to make lipidomics analytically challenging. Without internal standards to match each lipid species, researchers often apply individual internal standards to a broad range of related lipids. To aid in standardizing and automating this relative quantitation process, we developed LipidMatch Normalizer (LMN) http://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/which can be used in most open source lipidomics workflows. Results: LMN uses a ranking system (1-3) to assign lipid standards to target analytes. A ranking of 1 signifies that both the lipid class and adduct of the internal standard and target analyte match, while a ranking of 3 signifies that neither the adduct or class match. If multiple internal standards are provided for a lipid class, standards with the closest retention time to the target analyte will be chosen. The user can also signify which lipid classes an internal standard represents, for example indicating that ether-linked phosphatidylcholine can be semi-quantified using phosphatidylcholine. LMN is designed to work with any lipid identification software and feature finding software, and in this study is used to quantify lipids in NIST SRM 1950 human plasma annotated using LipidMatch and MZmine. Conclusions: LMN can be integrated into an open source workflow which completes all data processing steps including feature finding, annotation, and quantification for LC-MS/MS studies. Using LMN we determined that in certain cases the use of peak height versus peak area, certain adducts, and negative versus positive polarity data can have major effects on the final concentration obtained.","title":"Software tool for internal standard based normalization of lipids, and effect of data-processing strategies on resulting values","authors":[{"name":"Koelmel J.P."},{"name":"Cochran J.A."},{"name":"Ulmer C.Z."},{"name":"Levy A.J."},{"name":"Patterson R.E."},{"name":"Olsen B.C."},{"name":"Yost R.A."},{"name":"Bowden J.A."},{"name":"Garrett T.J."}]},"pmid":"31035918","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6489209","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-019-2803-8"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799"},{"term":"Retention time prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3633"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jason Cochran","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"j.a.cochran.cs@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jeremy Koelmel","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jeremykoelmel@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://github.com/GarrettLab-UF/LipidMatch-Normalizer/blob/master/2018_07_19_LMN_Instructions.docx?raw=true"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.2"],"toolType":["Script"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:LipidMatch_Normalizer","biotoolsID":"LipidMatch_Normalizer","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"LipidMatch Normalizer","topic":[{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Workflows","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0769"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-20T13:49:04Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/lipidmatch-normalizer/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/chhh/deltamass/issues"}],"description":"Automated detection and visualization of mass shifts in proteomic open search results.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":"Windows binaries also available","type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/chhh/deltamass/releases"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Routine identification of thousands of proteins in a single LC-MS experiment has long become the norm. With these vast amounts of data, more rigorous treatment of modified forms of peptides becomes possible. \"Open search\", a protein database search with a large precursor ion mass tolerance window, is becoming a popular method to evaluate possible sets of post-translational and chemical modifications in samples. The extraction of statistical information about the modification from peptide search results requires additional effort and data processing, such as recalibration of masses and accurate detection of precursors in MS1 signals. Here we present a software tool, DeltaMass, which performs kernel-density-based estimation of observed mass shifts and allows for the detection of poorly resolved mass deltas. The software also maps observed mass shifts to known modifications from public databases such as UniMod and augments them with additionally generated possible chemical changes to the molecule. Its interactive graphical interface provides an effective option for the visual interrogation of the data and the identification of potentially interesting mass shifts or unusual artifacts for subsequent analysis. However, the program can also be used in fully automated command-line mode to generate mass-shift peak lists as well.","title":"DeltaMass: Automated Detection and Visualization of Mass Shifts in Proteomic Open-Search Results","authors":[{"name":"Avtonomov D.M."},{"name":"Kong A."},{"name":"Nesvizhskii A.I."}]},"pmid":"30523686","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":"1.0","doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00728."}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Molecular mass","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0844"},"format":[]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"},{"term":"mzIdentML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3247"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Mass spectra calibration","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3627"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dmitry Avtonomov","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://dmtavt.com/","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/chhh/deltamass/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:deltamass","biotoolsID":"deltamass","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"DeltaMass","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-01-16T15:57:27Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/chhh/deltamass"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"http://www.fgvis.com/expressvis/PPIExp"}],"description":"A web-based platform for building protein-protein interaction networks, performing clustering analyses according to protein abundances, and functional enrichment analyses.","language":["JavaScript"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Integrating spatiotemporal proteomics data with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data can help researchers make an in-depth exploration of their proteins of interest in a dynamic manner.

To visualize the active PPI subnetworks in specific space or time, it provides buttons to highlight the differentially expressed proteins under each condition on the network map. Additionally, to help researchers determine which proteins are worth further attention, PPIExp provides extensive one-click interactive operations to map node centrality measures to node size on the network and highlight three types of proteins, that is, the proteins in an enriched functional term, the coexpressed proteins selected from the dendgrogram and heatmap, and the proteins input by users.

Multiplexing strategies are at the forefront of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, with SPS-MS3 methods becoming increasingly commonplace. A known caveat of isobaric multiplexing is interference resulting from coisolated and cofragmented ions that do not originate from the selected precursor of interest. The triple knockout (TKO) standard was designed to benchmark data collection strategies to minimize interference. However, a limitation to its widespread use has been the lack of an automated analysis platform. We present a TKO Visualization Tool (TVT). The TVT viewer allows for automated, web-based, database searching of the TKO standard, returning traditional figures of merit, such as peptide and protein counts, scan-specific ion accumulation times, as well as the TKO-specific metric, the IFI (interference-free index). Moreover, the TVT viewer allows for plotting of two TKO standards to assess protocol optimizations, compare instruments, or measure degradation of instrument performance over time. We showcase the TVT viewer by probing the selection of (1) stationary phase resin, (2) MS2 isolation window width, and (3) number of synchronous precursor selection (SPS) ions for SPS-MS3 analysis. Using the TVT viewer will allow the proteomics community to search and compare TKO results to optimize user-specific data collection workflows.","title":"Web-Based Search Tool for Visualizing Instrument Performance Using the Triple Knockout (TKO) Proteome Standard","authors":[{"name":"Gygi J.P."},{"name":"Yu Q."},{"name":"Navarrete-Perea J."},{"name":"Rad R."},{"name":"Gygi S.P."},{"name":"Paulo J.A."}]},"pmid":"30451507","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00737"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[{"term":"png","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3603"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"},{"term":"Chromatogram visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3203"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Joao Paulo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"joao_paulo@hms.harward.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jeremy Gygi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jeremy.gygi@yale.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tvt_viewer","biotoolsID":"tvt_viewer","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"TVT viewer","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Data quality management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3572"}],"additionDate":"2019-01-23T15:21:10Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://elk.med.harvard.edu/gfy/www/modules/single_standard"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/XINA.html"}],"description":"An R package for network analyses from multiplexed, time-resolved proteomics or trascriptomics data","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":"1.1.1","url":"https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/XINA.html"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Quantitative proteomics experiments, using for instance isobaric tandem mass tagging approaches, are conducive to measuring changes in protein abundance over multiple time points in response to one or more conditions or stimulations. The aim is often to determine which proteins exhibit similar patterns within and across experimental conditions, since proteins with coabundance patterns may have common molecular functions related to a given stimulation. In order to facilitate the identification and analyses of coabundance patterns within and across conditions, we previously developed a software inspired by the isobaric mass tagging method itself. Specifically, multiple data sets are tagged in silico and combined for subsequent subgrouping into multiple clusters within a single output depicting the variation across all conditions, converting a typical inter-data-set comparison into an intra-data-set comparison. An updated version of our software, XINA, not only extracts coabundance profiles within and across experiments but also incorporates protein-protein interaction databases and integrative resources such as KEGG to infer interactors and molecular functions, respectively, and produces intuitive graphical outputs. In this report, we compare the kinetics profiles of >5600 unique proteins derived from three macrophage cell culture experiments and demonstrate through intuitive visualizations that XINA identifies key regulators of macrophage activation via their coabundance patterns.","title":"XINA: A Workflow for the Integration of Multiplexed Proteomics Kinetics Data with Network Analysis","authors":[{"name":"Lee L.H."},{"name":"Halu A."},{"name":"Morgan S."},{"name":"Iwata H."},{"name":"Aikawa M."},{"name":"Singh S.A."}]},"pmid":"30370770","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":"1.1.1","doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00615"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[{"term":"PDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3508"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Pathway or network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Sasha A.

As a result of recent improvements in mass spectrometry (MS), there is increased interest in data-independent acquisition (DIA) strategies in which all peptides are systematically fragmented using wide mass-isolation windows ('multiplex fragmentation'). DIA-Umpire (http://diaumpire.sourceforge.net/), a comprehensive computational workflow and open-source software for DIA data, detects precursor and fragment chromatographic features and assembles them into pseudo-tandem MS spectra. These spectra can be identified with conventional database-searching and protein-inference tools, allowing sensitive, untargeted analysis of DIA data without the need for a spectral library. Quantification is done with both precursor- and fragment-ion intensities. Furthermore, DIA-Umpire enables targeted extraction of quantitative information based on peptides initially identified in only a subset of the samples, resulting in more consistent quantification across multiple samples. We demonstrated the performance of the method with control samples of varying complexity and publicly available glycoproteomics and affinity purification-MS data.","title":"DIA-Umpire: Comprehensive computational framework for data-independent acquisition proteomics","authors":[{"name":"Tsou C.-C."},{"name":"Avtonomov D."},{"name":"Larsen B."},{"name":"Tucholska M."},{"name":"Choi H."},{"name":"Gingras A.-C."},{"name":"Nesvizhskii A.I."}]},"pmid":"25599550","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Spectrum calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860"},{"term":"Retention time prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3633"},{"term":"Mass spectra calibration","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3627"}]},{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]},{"data":{"term":"Expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"protXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3747"},{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"}]},{"data":{"term":"Sequence set","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0850"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral library search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3801"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Chih-Chiang Tsou","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"tsouc@umich.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dmitry Avtonomov","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"dmitriya@umich.edu","typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alexey I Nesvizhskii","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"nesvi@umich.edu","typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"vtsiamis","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/diaumpire/files/Manual/"}],"community":null,"version":["2.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:DIA-Umpire","biotoolsID":"DIA-Umpire","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"DIA-Umpire","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-18T13:32:21Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/diaumpire/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"R package for PTM site localization and motif extraction from proteomic datasets.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":3,"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"PeerJ","abstract":"Copyright 2019 Wozniak and GonzalezBackground. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics is a prominent field of study that allows for the unbiased quantification of thousands of proteins from a particular sample. A key advantage of these techniques is the ability to detect protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and localize them to specific amino acid residues. These approaches have led to many significant findings in a wide range of biological disciplines, from developmental biology to cancer and infectious diseases. However, there is a current lack of tools available to connect raw PTM site information to biologically meaningful results in a high-throughput manner. Furthermore, many of the available tools require significant programming knowledge to implement. Results. The R package PTMphinder was designed to enable researchers, particularly those with minimal programming background, to thoroughly analyze PTMs in proteomic data sets. The package contains three functions: parseDB, phindPTMs and extractBackground. Together, these functions allow users to reformat proteome databases for easier analysis, localize PTMs within full proteins, extract motifs surrounding the identified sites and create proteome-specific motif backgrounds for statistical purposes. Beta-testing of this R package has demonstrated its simplicity and ease of integration with existing tools. Conclusion. PTMphinder empowers researchers to fully analyze and interpret PTMs derived from proteomic data. This package is simple enough for researchers with limited programming experience to understand and implement. The data produced from this package can inform subsequent research by itself and also be used in conjunction with other tools, such as motif-x, for further analysis.","title":"PTMPhinder: An R package for PTM site localization and motif extraction from proteomic datasets","authors":[{"name":"Wozniak J.M."},{"name":"Gonzalez D.J."}]},"pmid":"31198645","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6555389","version":null,"doi":"10.7717/peerj.7046"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Post-translation modification site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"},{"term":"PTM localisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3755"},{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jacob M.

PECAN reports evidence of detection based on product ion scoring, which enables detection of low-abundance analytes with poor precursor ion signal. We demonstrate the chromatographic peak picking accuracy and peptide detection capability of PECAN, and we further validate its detection with data-dependent acquisition and targeted analyses.

Research","abstract":"© 2019 Shao et al.The origination of new genes contributes to phenotypic evolution in humans. Two major challenges in the study of new genes are the inference of gene ages and annotation of their protein-coding potential. To tackle these challenges, we created GenTree, an integrated online database that compiles age inferences from three major methods together with functional genomic data for new genes. Genome-wide comparison of the age inference methods revealed that the synteny-based pipeline (SBP) is most suited for recently duplicated genes, whereas the protein-family\u2013based methods are useful for ancient genes. For SBP-dated primate-specific protein-coding genes (PSGs), we performed manual evaluation based on published PSG lists and showed that SBP generated a conservative data set of PSGs by masking less reliable syntenic regions. After assessing the coding potential based on evolutionary constraint and peptide evidence from proteomic data, we curated a list of 254 PSGs with different levels of protein evidence. This list also includes 41 candidate misannotated pseudogenes that encode primate-specific short proteins. Coexpression analysis showed that PSGs are preferentially recruited into organs with rapidly evolving pathways such as spermatogenesis, immune response, mother\u2013fetus interaction, and brain development. For brain development, primate-specific KRAB zinc-finger proteins (KZNFs) are specifically up-regulated in the mid-fetal stage, which may have contributed to the evolution of this critical stage. Altogether, hundreds of PSGs are either recruited to processes under strong selection pressure or to processes supporting an evolving novel organ.","title":"GenTree, an integrated resource for analyzing the evolution and function of primate-specific coding genes","authors":[{"name":"Shao Y."},{"name":"Chen C."},{"name":"Shen H."},{"name":"He B.Z."},{"name":"Yu D."},{"name":"Jiang S."},{"name":"Zhao S."},{"name":"Gao Z."},{"name":"Zhu Z."},{"name":"Chen X."},{"name":"Fu Y."},{"name":"Chen H."},{"name":"Gao G."},{"name":"Long M."},{"name":"Zhang Y.E."}]},"pmid":"30862647","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6442393","version":null,"doi":"10.1101/gr.238733.118"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"},{"term":"Haplotype mapping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0487"},{"term":"Weighted correlation network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3766"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","name":"ZhangLab","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"zhanglabioz@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application","Web service"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:GenTree","biotoolsID":"GenTree","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"GenTree","topic":[{"term":"Mapping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0102"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Gene transcripts","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3512"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-21T08:13:10Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://gentree.ioz.ac.cn/index.php"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/bzhanglab/PepQuery/issues"}],"description":"Peptide-centric search engine for novel peptide identification and validation.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Downloads page","version":null,"url":"http://www.pepquery.org/download.html"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":1,"date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Genome Research","abstract":"© 2019 Wen et al. Massively parallel or second-generation sequencing-based genomic studies continuously identify new genomic alterations that may lead to novel protein sequences, which are attractive candidates for disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets after proteomic validation. Integrative proteogenomic methods have been developed to use mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data for such validation. These methods replace the reference sequence database in proteomic database searching with a customized protein database that incorporates sample- or disease-specific sequences derived from DNA or RNA sequencing, thus enabling the identification of novel protein sequences. Although useful, this spectrum-centric approach requires a full evaluation of all possible spectrum-peptide pairs, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to apply. Here, we present PepQuery, a peptide-centric approach that focuses on only novel DNA or protein sequences of interest. PepQuery allows quick and easy proteomic validation of genomic alterations without customized database construction. We demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of the approach in validating completely novel proteins, novel splice junctions, and single amino acid variants using simulations and experimental data. Notably, enabling unrestricted modification searching in PepQuery reduced false positives by up to 95%. We implemented PepQuery as both web-based and stand-alone applications. The web version provides direct access to more than half a billion MS/MS spectra from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and other cancer proteomic studies. The stand-alone version supports batch analysis and user-provided MS/MS data. PepQuery will increase the usage of proteogenomics beyond the proteomics community and will broaden the application of proteogenomics in personalized medicine.","title":"PepQuery enables fast,

Data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry is a powerful technique that is improving the reproducibility and throughput of proteomics studies. Here, we introduce an experimental workflow that uses this technique to construct chromatogram libraries that capture fragment ion chromatographic peak shape and retention time for every detectable peptide in a proteomics experiment. These coordinates calibrate protein databases or spectrum libraries to a specific mass spectrometer and chromatography setup, facilitating DIA-only pipelines and the reuse of global resource libraries. We also present EncyclopeDIA, a software tool for generating and searching chromatogram libraries, and demonstrate the performance of our workflow by quantifying proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that by exploiting calibrated retention time and fragmentation specificity in chromatogram libraries, EncyclopeDIA can detect 20\u201325% more peptides from DIA experiments than with data dependent acquisition-based spectrum libraries alone.","title":"Chromatogram libraries improve peptide detection and quantification by data independent acquisition mass spectrometry","authors":[{"name":"Searle B.C."},{"name":"Pino L.K."},{"name":"Egertson J.D."},{"name":"Ting Y.S."},{"name":"Lawrence R.T."},{"name":"MacLean B.X."},{"name":"Villen J."},{"name":"MacCoss M.J."}]},"pmid":"30510204","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"SQLite format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3621"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"TraML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3246"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]},{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"SQLite format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3621"}]},{"data":{"term":"Sequence set","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0850"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Spectrum calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":null,"name":"Brian Searle","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"bsearle@systemsbiology.org","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"vtsiamis","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia/downloads/EncyclopeDIA%20manual.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["0.8.1"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:EncyclopeDIA","biotoolsID":"EncyclopeDIA","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"EncyclopeDIA","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-18T12:42:38Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Portal designed to provide a comprehensive gene list annotation and analysis resource for experimental biologists.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":388,"date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Communications","abstract":"© 2019, The Author(s).A critical component in the interpretation of systems-level studies is the inference of enriched biological pathways and protein complexes contained within OMICs datasets.

However, several factors, including extensive regulation of mRNA translation and the need for threeor six-frame-translation, impede the use of mRNAseq data for the construction of a protein sequence search database.With that inmind, we developed the PROTEOFORMER tool that automatically processes data of the recently developed ribosome profiling method (sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), resulting in genome-wide visualization of ribosome occupancy. Our tool also includes a translation initiation site calling algorithm allowing the delineation of the open reading frames (ORFs) of all translation products. A complete protein synthesisbased sequence database can thus be compiled for mass spectrometry-based identification. This approach increases the overall protein identification rates with 3% and 11% (improved and new identifications) for human and mouse, respectively, and enables proteome-wide detection of 5'-extended proteoforms, upstream ORF translation and near-cognate translation start sites.

Herein, protein complexes are among the most tightly controlled entities by selective degradation of their individual proteins. They furthermore act as control hubs that regulate highly important processes in the cell and exhibit a high functional diversity due to their ability to change their composition and their structure. Better understanding and prediction of these functional states demands methods for the characterization of complex composition, behavior, and abundance across multiple cell states. Mass spectrometry provides an unbiased approach to directly determine protein abundances across different cell populations and thus to profile a comprehensive abundance map of proteins. Results: We provide a tool to investigate the behavior of protein subunits in known complexes by comparing their abundance profiles across up to 140 cell types available in ProteomicsDB. Thorough assessment of different randomization methods and statistical scoring algorithms allows determining the significance of concurrent profiles within a complex, therefore providing insights into the conservation of their composition across human cell types as well as the identification of intrinsic structures in complex behavior to determine which proteins orchestrate complex function. This analysis can be extended to investigate common profiles within arbitrary protein groups. CoExpresso can be accessed through http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Apps/CoExpresso.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Kinase-regulated phosphorylation is a ubiquitous type of post-translational modification (PTM) in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Phosphorylation plays fundamental roles in many signalling pathways and biological processes, such as protein degradation and protein-protein interactions. Experimental studies have revealed that signalling defects caused by aberrant phosphorylation are highly associated with a variety of human diseases, especially cancers. In light of this, a number of computational methods aiming to accurately predict protein kinase family-specific or kinase-specific phosphorylation sites have been established, thereby facilitating phosphoproteomic data analysis. Results: In this work, we present Quokka, a novel bioinformatics tool that allows users to rapidly and accurately identify human kinase family-regulated phosphorylation sites. Quokka was developed by using a variety of sequence scoring functions combined with an optimized logistic regression algorithm.

The benchmarking reveals that co-phosphorylation analysis can significantly improve prediction performance when static information is available (about 35% of sites) while providing reliable predictions for the remainder, thus tripling the KSAs available from the experimental MS data providing to a comprehensive and reliable characterization of the landscape of kinase-substrate interactions well beyond current limitations.","title":"CoPhosK: A method for comprehensive kinase substrate annotation using co-phosphorylation analysis","authors":[{"name":"Ayati M."},{"name":"Wiredja D."},{"name":"Schlatzer D."},{"name":"Maxwell S."},{"name":"Li M."},{"name":"Koyuturk M."},{"name":"Chance M.R."}]},"pmid":"30811403","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6411229","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006678"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Post-translation modification site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"},{"term":"Enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"},{"term":"iTRAQ","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3639"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Marzieh Ayati","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"marzieh@case.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact","Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Mehmet Koyuturk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Mark R.

In this study, we provide evidence that a docking algorithm has the ability to identify real interactions using both experimentally determined and predicted protein structures. We ranked 0.91 million interactions generated by all possible pairwise combinations of 1,346 predicted structure models from an Arabidopsis predicted \u201cstructure-ome\u201d and found a significant enrichment of real interactions for the topranking predicted interactions, as shown by cosubcellular enrichment analysis and yeast two-hybrid validation. Our success rate for computationally predicted, structure-based interactions was 63% of the success rate for published interactions naively tested using the yeast two-hybrid system and 2.7 times better than for randomly picked pairs of proteins. This study provides another perspective in interactome exploration and biological network reconstruction using protein structural information. We have made these interactions freely accessible through an improved Arabidopsis Interactions Viewer and have created community tools for accessing these and;2.8 million other protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions for hypothesis generation by researchers worldwide.

Motivation: Mass spectrometry combined with enrichment strategies for phosphorylated peptides has been successfully employed for two decades to identify sites of phosphorylation. However, unambiguous phosphosite assignment is considered challenging. Given that site-specific phosphorylation events function as different molecular switches, validation of phosphorylation sites is of utmost importance. In our earlier study we developed a method based on simulated phosphopeptide spectral libraries, which enables highly sensitive and accurate phosphosite assignments. To promote more widespread use of this method, we here introduce a software implementation with improved usability and performance. Results: We present SimPhospho, a fast and user-friendly tool for accurate simulation of phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra. Simulated phosphopeptide spectral libraries are used to validate and supplement database search results, with a goal to improve reliable phosphoproteome identification and reporting. The presented program can be easily used together with the Trans- Proteomic Pipeline and integrated in a phosphoproteomics data analysis workflow.","title":"SimPhospho: A software tool enabling

Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Most approaches used to identify cancer driver genes focus, true to their name, on entire genes and assume that a gene, treated as one entity, has a specific role in cancer. This approach may be correct to describe effects of gene loss or changes in gene expression; however, mutations may have different effects, including their relevance to cancer, depending on which region of the gene they affect. Except for rare and well-known exceptions, there are not enough data for reliable statistics for individual positions, but an intermediate level of analysis, between an individual position and the entire gene, may give us better statistics than the former and better resolution than the latter approach. Results: We have developed e-Driver, a method that exploits the internal distribution of somatic missense mutations between the protein's functional regions (domains or intrinsically disordered regions) to find those that show a bias in their mutation rate as compared with other regions of the same protein, providing evidence of positive selection and suggesting that these proteins may be actual cancer drivers. We have applied e-Driver to a large cancer genome dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared its performance with that of four other methods, showing that e-Driver identifies novel candidate cancer drivers and, because of its increased resolution, provides deeper insights into the potential mechanism of cancer driver genes identified by other methods.","title":"E-Driver: A novel method to identify protein regions driving cancer","authors":[{"name":"Porta-Pardo E."},{"name":"Godzik A."}]},"pmid":"25064568","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu499"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein folding analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2415"},{"term":"Variant pattern analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3504"},{"term":"Protein interaction analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2949"},{"term":"Variant classification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3225"},{"term":"Gene prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2454"},{"term":"Genetic variation analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7900-4239","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Eduard Porta-Pardo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.bsc.es/porta-pardo-eduard","email":"eduard.porta@bsc.es","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Adam Godzik","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"adam@godziklab.org","typeRole":["Maintainer"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"javi-gv94","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver/blob/master/USAGE_e-Driver.txt"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:e-Driver","biotoolsID":"e-Driver","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:22Z","name":"e-Driver","topic":[{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Oncology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2640"},{"term":"DNA polymorphism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2885"},{"term":"Protein interactions","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0128"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"}],"additionDate":"2019-02-15T09:30:25Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Programfor calculation of  ion or molecule collision cross sections on parallelized computing architectures.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":1,"date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00Z","journal":"Analyst","abstract":"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019. Ion mobility-based separation prior to mass spectrometry has become an invaluable tool in the structural elucidation of gas-phase ions and in the characterization of complex mixtures. Application of ion mobility to structural studies requires an accurate methodology to bridge theoretical modelling of chemical structure with experimental determination of an ion's collision cross section (CCS). Herein, we present a refined methodology for calculating ion CCS using parallel computing architectures that makes use of atom specific parameters, which we have called MobCal-MPI. Tuning of ion-nitrogen Van Der Waals potentials on a diverse calibration set of 162 molecules returned a RMSE of 2.60% in CCS calculations of molecules containing the elements C, H, O, N, F, P, S, Cl, Br, and I. External validation of the ion-nitrogen potential was performed on an additional 50 compounds not present in the validation set, returning a RMSE of 2.31% for the CCSs of these compounds. Owing to the use of parameters from the MMFF94 forcefield, the calibration of the Van Der Waals potential can be extended to additional atoms defined in the MMFF94 forcefield (i.e., Li, Na, K, Si, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn). We expect that the work presented here will serve as a foundation for facile determination of molecular CCSs, as MobCal-MPI boasts up to 64-fold speedups over traditional calculation packages.","title":"A parallelized molecular collision cross section package with optimized accuracy and efficiency","authors":[{"name":"Ieritano C."},{"name":"Crouse J."},{"name":"Campbell J.L."},{"name":"Hopkins W.S."}]},"pmid":"30649115","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1039/c8an02150c"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein dipole moment calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0386"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"C.

The prediction of gene structure remains difficult, especially for eukaryotic species, and is often erroneous and incomplete. We used a proteogenomics strategy, taking advantage of the combination of proteomics datasets and bioinformatics tools, to identify novel protein coding-genes and splice isoforms, assign correct start sites, and validate predicted exons and genes. Results: Our proteogenomics workflow, Peptimapper, was applied to the genome annotation of Ectocarpus sp., a key reference genome for both the brown algal lineage and stramenopiles. We generated proteomics data from various life cycle stages of Ectocarpus sp. strains and sub-cellular fractions using a shotgun approach. First, we directly generated peptide sequence tags (PSTs) from the proteomics data. Second, we mapped PSTs onto the translated genomic sequence. Closely located hits (i.e., PSTs locations on the genome) were then clustered to detect potential coding regions based on parameters optimized for the organism. Third, we evaluated each cluster and compared it to gene predictions from existing conventional genome annotation approaches. Finally, we integrated cluster locations into GFF files to use a genome viewer. We identified two potential novel genes, a ribosomal protein L22 and an aryl sulfotransferase and corrected the gene structure of a dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase. We experimentally validated the results by RT-PCR and using transcriptomics data. Conclusions: Peptimapper is a complementary tool for the expert annotation of genomes. It is suitable for any organism and is distributed through a Docker image available on two public bioinformatics docker repositories: Docker Hub and BioShaDock.

Intracellular metabolic rates are commonly evaluated using labeling pattern of the identified metabolites obtained from stable isotope labeling experiments. The labeling pattern or mass distribution vector describes the fractional abundances of all isotopologs with different masses as a result of isotopic labeling, which are typically resolved using mass spectrometry. Because naturally occurring isotopes and isotopic impurity also contribute to measured signals, the measured patterns must be corrected to obtain the labeling patterns. Since contaminant isotopologs with the same nominal mass can be resolved using modern mass spectrometers with high mass resolution, the correction process should be resolution dependent. Results: Here we present a software tool, ElemCor, to perform correction of such data in a resolution-dependent manner. The tool is based on mass difference theory (MDT) and information from unlabeled samples (ULS) to account for resolution effects. MDT is a mathematical theory and only requires chemical formulae to perform correction. ULS is semi-empirical and requires additional measurement of isotopologs from unlabeled samples. We validate both methods and show their improvement in accuracy and comprehensiveness over existing methods using simulated data and experimental data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tool is available at https://github.com/4dsoftware/elemcor. Conclusions: We present a software tool based on two methods, MDT and ULS, to correct LC-MS data from isotopic labeling experiments for natural abundance and isotopic impurity. We recommend MDT for low-mass compounds for cost efficiency in experiments, and ULS for high-mass compounds with relatively large spectral inaccuracy that can be tracked by unlabeled standards.","title":"ElemCor: Accurate data analysis and enrichment calculation for high-resolution LC-MS stable isotope labeling experiments","authors":[{"name":"Du D."},{"name":"Tan L."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Peng B."},{"name":"Weinstein J.N."},{"name":"Wondisford F.E."},{"name":"Su X."},{"name":"Lorenzi P.L."}]},"pmid":"30782135","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC6381631","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-019-2669-9"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"SILAC","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3638"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"},{"term":"Isotopic distributions calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3632"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Di Du","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"dudthu06@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Xiaoyang Su","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"xs137@rwjms.rutgers.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ElemCor","biotoolsID":"ElemCor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:22Z","name":"ElemCor","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Endocrinology and metabolism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3407"}],"additionDate":"2019-05-19T07:18:32Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/4dsoftware/elemcor"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Tool with multiple built-in data processing functions, allowing non-expert users to construct circular proteome maps (CPMs) or in general terms circular plots with a non-genomic basis.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/ms-helios/code/ci/master/tree/"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2019-01-11T00:00:00Z","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitate the identification of hundreds of metabolites, thousands of proteins and their post-translational modifications.

Top-down proteomics, the analysis of intact proteins in their endogenous form, preserves valuable information about post-translation modifications, isoforms and proteolytic processing. The quality of top-down liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) data sets is rapidly increasing on account of advances in instrumentation and sample-processing protocols. However, top-down mass spectra are substantially more complex than conventional bottom-up data. New algorithms and software tools for confident proteoform identification and quantification are needed. Here we present Informed-Proteomics, an open-source software suite for top-down proteomics analysis that consists of an LC-MS feature-finding algorithm, a database search algorithm, and an interactive results viewer.

The large size and vast amount of information inherent to these data sets need to be properly structured to enable an efficient and straightforward extraction of the signals used to identify specific target peptides. Standard XML based formats are not well suited to large MS data files, for example, those generated by SWATH-MS, and compromise high-throughput data processing and storing. We developed mzDB, an efficient file format for large MS data sets. It relies on the SQLite software library and consists of a standardized and portable server-less single-file database. An optimized 3D indexing approach is adopted, where the LC-MS coordinates (retention time and m/z), along with the precursor m/z for SWATH-MS data, are used to query the database for data extraction. In comparison with XML formats, mzDB saves ∼ 25% of storage space and improves access times by a factor of twofold up to even 2000-fold, depending on the particular data access. Similarly, mzDB shows also slightly to significantly lower access times in comparison with other formats like mz5. Both C++ and Java implementations, converting raw or XML formats to mzDB and providing access methods, will be released under permissive license. mzDB can be easily accessed by the SQLite C library and its drivers for all major languages, and browsed with existing dedicated GUIs. The mzDB described here can boost existing mass spectrometry data analysis pipelines, offering unprecedented performance in terms of efficiency, portability, compactness, and flexibility.","title":"MzDB: A file format using multiple indexing strategies for the efficient analysis of large LC-MS/MS and SWATH-MS data sets","authors":[{"name":"Bouyssie D."},{"name":"Dubois M."},{"name":"Nasso S."},{"name":"De Peredo A.G."},{"name":"Burlet-Schiltz O."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Monsarrat B."}]},"pmid":"25505153","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC4349994","version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"SQLite format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3621"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"WIFF format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3710"},{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Conversion","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3434"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Consortium","name":"ProFI","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://profiproteomics.fr/","email":null,"typeRole":["Contributor"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alexandre Burel","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"alexandre.burel@unistra.fr","typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"David Bouyssié","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"David.Bouyssie@ipbs.fr","typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alexandre Burel","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"alexandre.burel@unistra.fr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"alexandre.burel","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/mzdb/pwiz-mzdb/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":["0.9.9"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:raw2mzdb","biotoolsID":"raw2mzdb","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:21Z","name":"raw2mzDB","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-16T09:14:09Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/mzdb/pwiz-mzdb"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":"Download MSqRob","type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/ludgergoeminne/MSqRob/"}],"description":"Allows a user to do quantitative protein-level statistical inference on label-free LC-MS proteomics data.

However, numerous issues inherent to the mass spectrometry workflow turn quantitative proteomic data analysis into a crucial challenge. We and others have shown that modeling at the peptide level outperforms classical summarization-based approaches, which typically also discard a lot of proteins at the data preprocessing step. Peptide-based linear regression models, however, still suffer from unbalanced datasets due to missing peptide intensities, outlying peptide intensities and overfitting. Here, we further improve upon peptide-based models by three modular extensions: ridge regression, improved variance estimation by borrowing information across proteins with empirical Bayes and M-estimation with Huber weights. We illustrate our method on the CPTAC spike-in study and on a study comparing wild-Type and ArgP knock-out Francisella tularensis proteomes. We show that the fold change estimates of our robust approach are more precise and more accurate than those from stateof-the-Art summarization-based methods and peptidebased regression models, which leads to an improved sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that ionization competition effects come already into play at very low spike-in concentrations and confirm that analyses with peptide-based regression methods on peptide intensity values aggregated by charge state and modification status (e.g. MaxQuant's peptides.txt file) are slightly superior to analyses on raw peptide intensity values (e.g. Max-Quant's evidence.txt file).","title":"Peptide-level robust ridge regression improves estimation, sensitivity, and specificity in data-dependent quantitative label-free shotgun proteomics","authors":[{"name":"Goeminne L.J.E."},{"name":"Gevaert K."},{"name":"Clement L."}]},"pmid":"26566788","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC4739679","version":null,"doi":"10.1074/mcp.M115.055897"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[]},{"data":{"term":"Report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"},{"term":"xls","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3468"}]}],"note":"MSqRob allows relative quantification in label-free proteomics data for all kinds of experimental designs.

Although protein identification of samples generated using iTRAQ may be carried out using any current identification software, the quantitation calculations have been restricted to the ProQuant software supplied by Applied Biosciences. i-Tracker software has been developed to extract reporter ion peak ratios from non-centroided tandem MS peak lists in a format easily linked to the results of protein identification tools such as Mascot and Sequest. Such functionality is currently not provided by ProQuant, which is restricted to matching quantitative information to the peptide identifications from Applied Biosciences' Interrogator™ software. Results: i-Tracker is shown to generate results that are consistent with those produced by ProQuant, thus validating both systems. Conclusions: i-Tracker allows quantitative information gained using the iTRAQ protocol to be linked with peptide identifications from popular tandem MS identification tools and hence is both a timely

2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein-protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification-mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.","title":"Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks","authors":[{"name":"Huttlin E.L."},{"name":"Bruckner R.J."},{"name":"Paulo J.A."},{"name":"Cannon J.R."},{"name":"Ting L."},{"name":"Baltier K."},{"name":"Colby G."},{"name":"Gebreab F."},{"name":"Gygi M.P."},{"name":"Parzen H."},{"name":"Szpyt J."},{"name":"Tam S."},{"name":"Zarraga G."},{"name":"Pontano-Vaites L."},{"name":"Swarup S."},{"name":"White A.E."},{"name":"Schweppe D.K."},{"name":"Rad R."},{"name":"Erickson B.K."},{"name":"Obar R.A."},{"name":"Guruharsha K.G."},{"name":"Li K."},{"name":"Artavanis-Tsakonas S."},{"name":"Gygi S.P."},{"name":"Wade Harper J."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nature22366"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Pathway or network","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2600"},"format":[{"term":"Map format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2060"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Gene identifier","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1025"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"},{"term":"Data retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"},{"term":"Pathway or network visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Wade Harper","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"wade_harper@hms.harvard.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bioplex_2.0","biotoolsID":"bioplex_2.0","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:21Z","name":"BioPlex 2.0","topic":[{"term":"Protein interactions","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0128"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Data integration and warehousing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3366"}],"additionDate":"2018-06-04T16:14:35Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"A database search tool for performing mass spectometry data similarity comparisons.

We present a fragment-ion indexing method, and its implementation in peptide identification tool MSFragger, that enables a more than 100-fold improvement in speed over most existing proteome database search tools. Using several large proteomic data sets, we demonstrate how MSFragger empowers the open database search concept for comprehensive identification of peptides and all their modified forms, uncovering dramatic differences in modification rates across experimental samples and conditions. We further illustrate its utility using protein-RNA cross-linked peptide data and using affinity purification experiments where we observe, on average, a 300% increase in the number of identified spectra for enriched proteins. We also discuss the benefits of open searching for improved false discovery rate estimation in proteomics.","title":"MSFragger: Ultrafast and comprehensive peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics","authors":[{"name":"Kong A.T."},{"name":"Leprevost F.V."},{"name":"Avtonomov D.M."},{"name":"Mellacheruvu D."},{"name":"Nesvizhskii A.I."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4256"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Database search results","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2080"},"format":[]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3483"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"},{"term":"Spectral library search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3801"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alexey Nesvizhskii","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"nesvi@umich.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Script"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msfragger","biotoolsID":"msfragger","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:21Z","name":"MSFragger","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"}],"additionDate":"2018-06-11T09:48:30Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.nesvilab.org/software"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Apply standard pre-processing, statistical analysis, advanced visualization methods and network reconstruction methods on single-cell cytometry data.

This development has been enabled by powerful software packages for the automated analysis of MS data. While data on PTMs of thousands of proteins can nowadays be readily obtained, fully deciphering the complexity and combinatorics of modification patterns even on a single protein often remains challenging. Moreover, functional investigation of PTMs on a protein of interest requires validation of the localization and the accurate quantitation of its changes across several conditions, tasks that often still require human evaluation. Software tools for large scale analyses are highly efficient but are rarely conceived for interactive, in-depth exploration of data on individual proteins. We here describe MsViz, a web-based and interactive software tool that supports manual validation of PTMs and their relative quantitation in small- and medium-size experiments. The tool displays sequence coverage information, peptide-spectrum matches, tandem MS spectra and extracted ion chromatograms through a single, highly intuitive interface. We found that MsViz greatly facilitates manual data inspection to validate PTM location and quantitate modified species across multiple samples.","title":"MsViz: A Graphical Software Tool for In-Depth Manual Validation and Quantitation of Post-translational Modifications","authors":[{"name":"Martin-Campos T."},{"name":"Mylonas R."},{"name":"Masselot A."},{"name":"Waridel P."},{"name":"Petricevic T."},{"name":"Xenarios I."},{"name":"Quadroni M."}]},"pmid":"28636386","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00194"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Ion counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3704"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":"Bioinformatician at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.","orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"Roman Mylonas","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.sib.swiss/people/Roman.Mylonas","email":"roman.mylonas@sib.swiss","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Roman Mylonas","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"roman.mylonas@sib.swiss","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"rmylonas","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://msviz-docs.vital-it.ch/src/usage.html"},{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/vitalit-sib/msviz-docker/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.1"],"toolType":["Web API","Web application"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msviz","biotoolsID":"msviz","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-05-12T08:18:32Z","name":"MsViz","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-09-21T12:59:30Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://msviz-public.vital-it.ch"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A web resource for all viral genus and families, providing general molecular and epidemiological informations, along with virion and genome figures.

This creates an opportunity for bioinformatics tool developers. Tools can be made to flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage.

This framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations. BridgeDb provides its own ready-to-go mapping services, both in webservice and local database forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and adaptation to any identifier mapping service. BridgeDb has already been integrated into several bioinformatics applications.Conclusion: By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools.

To date, there are only a few software solutions available that make use of these properties, but none allows for an automated analysis of cleavable cross-linked products. The MeroX software fills this gap and presents a powerful tool for protein 3D-structure analysis in combination with MS/MS cleavable cross-linkers.

No manual input is required for a correct assignment of cross-links and false discovery rates are calculated. The self-explanatory graphical user interface of MeroX provides easy access for an automated cross-link search platform that is compatible with commonly used data file formats, enabling analysis of data originating from different instruments.

We evaluate different fragmentation methods available on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer for three proteins and an E. coli cell lysate. An updated version of the dedicated software tool MeroX was employed for a fully automated identification of cross-links. The strength of our cleavable cross-linker is that characteristic patterns of the cross-linker as well as backbone fragments of the connected peptides are already observed at the MS/MS level, eliminating the need for conducting MS3 or sequential CID (collision-induced dissociation)- and ETD (electron transfer dissociation)-MS/MS experiments. This makes our strategy applicable to a broad range of mass spectrometers with MS/MS capabilities. For purified proteins and protein complexes, our workflow using CID-MS/MS acquisition performs with high confidence, scoring cross-links at 0.5% false discovery rate (FDR). The cross-links provide structural insights into the intrinsically disordered tetrameric tumor suppressor protein p53. As a time-consuming manual inspection of cross-linking data is not required, our workflow will pave the way for making the cross-linking/MS approach a routine technique for structural proteomics studies.","title":"Integrated Workflow for Structural Proteomics Studies Based on Cross-Linking/Mass Spectrometry with an MS/MS Cleavable Cross-Linker","authors":[{"name":"Arlt C."},{"name":"Gotze M."},{"name":"Ihling C.H."},{"name":"Hage C."},{"name":"Schafer M."},{"name":"Sinz A."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04853"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":9,"date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Protocols","abstract":"© 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The commercially available, MS-cleavable cross-linkers (DSBU and CDI) used herein possess different lengths and react with amine as well as hydroxy groups. Owing to the formation of two characteristic 26-u doublets in their MS/MS spectra, many fewer false positives are found than when using classic, non-cleavable cross-linkers. The protocol, exemplified herein for BSA and the whole Escherichia coli ribosome, is robust and widely applicable, and it allows facile identification of cross-links for deriving spatial constraints from purified proteins and protein complexes.

Yet, one of the major drawbacks of this strategy remains the lack of software that is able to handle the large MS datasets that are created after chemical crosslinking and enzymatic digestion of the crosslinking reaction mixtures. Here, we describe a software, termed StavroX, which has been specifically designed for analyzing highly complex crosslinking datasets. The StavroX software was evaluated for three diverse biological systems: (1) the complex between calmodulin and a peptide derived from Munc13, (2) an N-terminal -laminin fragment, and (3) the complex between guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 and a peptide derived from retinal guanylyl cyclase. We show that the StavroX software is advantageous for analyzing crosslinked products due to its easy-to-use graphical user interface and the highly automated analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data resulting in short times for analysis. StavroX is expected to give a further push to the chemical crosslinking approach as a routine technique for protein interaction studies. © 2011 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.","title":"StavroX-A software for analyzing crosslinked products in protein interaction studies","authors":[{"name":"Gotze M."},{"name":"Pettelkau J."},{"name":"Schaks S."},{"name":"Bosse K."},{"name":"Ihling C.H."},{"name":"Krauth F."},{"name":"Fritzsche R."},{"name":"Kuhn U."},{"name":"Sinz A."}]},"pmid":"22038510","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"Format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1915"}]}],"note":"Operation: cross-linking/MS analysis\nOutput: zipped result file (.ZHRM), containing spectra, results and decoy analysis data","input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"},{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2886"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Operation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0004"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-2324","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Michael Götze","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Goetze","email":"info@StavroX.com","typeRole":["Developer"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"stavrox","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://www.StavroX.com/help.htm"}],"community":null,"version":["2.0 (2.0.0.7)"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Freeware","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MeroX","biotoolsID":"MeroX","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-01-19T17:48:06Z","name":"MeroX","topic":[{"term":"Structural biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_1317"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-04T07:24:49Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://www.stavrox.com"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus/issues"}],"description":"AUGUSTUS is a eukaryotic gene prediction tool.

Gene finding programs have achieved relatively high accuracy on short genomic sequences but do not perform well on longer sequences with an unknown number of genes in them.

The program is based on a Hidden Markov Model and integrates a number of known methods and submodels. It employs a new way of modeling intron lengths. We use a new donor splice site model, a new model for a short region directly upstream of the donor splice site model that takes the reading frame into account and apply a method that allows better GC-content dependent parameter estimation. AUGUSTUS predicts on longer sequences far more human and drosophila genes accurately than the ab initio gene prediction programs we compared it with, while at the same time being more specific.

However, such evidence is often incomplete and usually uncertain. The extrinsic evidence is usually not sufficient to recover the complete gene structure of all genes completely and the available evidence is often unreliable. Therefore extrinsic evidence is most valuable when it is balanced with sequence-intrinsic evidence. Results: We present a fairly general method for integration of external information. Our method is based on the evaluation of hints to potentially protein-coding regions by means of a Generalized Hidden Morkov Model (GHMM) that takes both intrinsic and extrinsic information into account. We used this method to extend the ab initio gene prediction program AUGUSTUS to a versatile tool that we call AUGUSTUS+. In this study, we focus on hints derived from matches to an EST or protein database, but our approach can be used to include arbitrary user-defined hints. Our method is only moderately effected by the length of a database match. Further, it exploits the information that can be derived from the absence of such matches. As a special case, AUGUSTUS+ can predict genes under user-defined constraints, e.g. if the positions of certain exons are known. With hints from EST and protein databases, our new approach was able to predict 89% of the exons in human chromosome 22 correctly. Conclusion: Sensitive probabilistic modeling of extrinsic evidence such as sequence database matches can increase gene prediction accuracy. When a match of a sequence interval to an EST or protein sequence is used it should be treated as compound information rather than as information about individual positions. © 2006 Stanke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Gene prediction in eukaryotes with a generalized hidden Markov model that uses hints from external sources","authors":[{"name":"Stanke M."},{"name":"Schoffmann O."},{"name":"Morgenstern B."},{"name":"Waack S."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-7-62"},{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"type":["Usage"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/gb-2006-7-s1-s11"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":451,"date":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes. Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available.

All rights reserved. Motivation: As the tree of life is populated with sequenced genomes ever more densely, the new challenge is the accurate and consistent annotation of entire clades of genomes. We address this problem with a new approach to comparative gene finding that takes a multiple genome alignment of closely related species and simultaneously predicts the location and structure of protein-coding genes in all input genomes, thereby exploiting negative selection and sequence conservation. The model prefers potential gene structures in the different genomes that are in agreement with each other, or - if not - where the exon gains and losses are plausible given the species tree. We formulate the multi-species gene finding problem as a binary labeling problem on a graph. The resulting optimization problem is NP hard, but can be efficiently approximated using a subgradient-based dual decomposition approach. Results: The proposed method was tested on whole-genome alignments of 12 vertebrate and 12 Drosophila species. The accuracy was evaluated for human, mouse and Drosophila melanogaster and compared to competing methods. Results suggest that our method is well-suited for annotation of (a large number of) genomes of closely related species within a clade, in particular, when RNA-Seq data are available for many of the genomes. The transfer of existing annotations from one genome to another via the genome alignment is more accurate than previous approaches that are based on protein-spliced alignments, when the genomes are at close to medium distances.","title":"Simultaneous gene finding in multiple genomes","authors":[{"name":"Konig S."},{"name":"Romoth L.W."},{"name":"Gerischer L."},{"name":"Stanke M."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw494"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":5,"date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Current Protocols in Bioinformatics","abstract":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.AUGUSTUS is a tool for finding protein-coding genes and their exon-intron structure in genomic sequences.

Based on the detected peak pattern, a similarity search in a custom spectral database can subsequently be performed for sample identification. When a spectrum is analyzed by comparison with a database entry, a percentage score value is calculated from the number of identical peak positions found (they are assigned with an adjustable mass tolerance) divided by the number of all detected peaks in the analyzed spectrum.

Recently data independent acquisition (DIA) approaches have emerged as an alternative to the traditional data dependent acquisition (DDA) in shotgun proteomics experiments. MSE is the term used to name one of the DIA approaches used in QTOF instruments. MSE data require specialized software to process acquired spectra and to perform peptide and protein identifications. However the software available at the moment does not group the identified proteins in a transparent way by taking into account peptide evidence categories. Furthermore the inspection, comparison and report of the obtained results require tedious manual intervention. Here we report a software tool to address these limitations for MSE data.Results: In this paper we present PAnalyzer, a software tool focused on the protein inference process of shotgun proteomics. Our approach considers all the identified proteins and groups them when necessary indicating their confidence using different evidence categories. PAnalyzer can read protein identification files in the XML output format of the ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) software provided by Waters Corporation for their MSE data, and also in the mzIdentML format recently standardized by HUPO-PSI. Multiple files can also be read simultaneously and are considered as technical replicates. Results are saved to CSV, HTML and mzIdentML (in the case of a single mzIdentML input file) files.

However, a large fraction of mitochondrial proteins lack such signals, making those tools ineffective for genome-scale prediction of mitochondria-targeted proteins. Here, we propose a method for genome-scale prediction of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins. The new method, MITOPRED, is based on the Pfam domain occurrence patterns and the amino acid compositional differences between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. Results: MITOPRED could predict mitochondrial proteins with 100% specificity at a 44% sensitivity rate and with 67% specificity at 99% sensitivity. Additionally, it was sufficiently robust to predict mitochondrial proteins across different eukaryotic species with similar accuracy. Based on Matthews correlation coefficient measure, the prediction performance of MITOPRED is clearly superior (0.73) to those of the two popular methods TargetP (0.51) and PSORT (0.53). Using this method, we predicted the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins from six complete genomes (three invertebrate, two vertebrate and one plant species) and estimated the total number in each genome. In human, our method estimated the existence of 1362 mitochondrial proteins corresponding to 4.8% of the total proteome. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","title":"MITOPRED: A genome-scale method for prediction of nucleus-encoded mitchondrial proteins","authors":[{"name":"Guda C."},{"name":"Fahy E."},{"name":"Subramaniam S."}]},"pmid":"15037509","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein fold recognition","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"},{"term":"Transmembrane protein prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"},{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"Wadege","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mitopred","biotoolsID":"mitopred","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-23T06:55:41Z","name":"MITOPRED","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Model organisms","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621"},{"term":"Sequence composition, complexity and repeats","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0157"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2017-02-10T11:34:23Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioinformatics.albany.edu/~mitopred/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Analyses peptide-peptide cross-links for protein-protein interaction or protein structure analysis.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"merox","type":"includedIn"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":166,"date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"Chemical crosslinking in combination with mass spectrometry has matured into an alternative approach to derive low-resolution structural information of proteins and protein complexes. Yet, one of the major drawbacks of this strategy remains the lack of software that is able to handle the large MS datasets that are created after chemical crosslinking and enzymatic digestion of the crosslinking reaction mixtures. Here, we describe a software, termed StavroX, which has been specifically designed for analyzing highly complex crosslinking datasets. The StavroX software was evaluated for three diverse biological systems: (1) the complex between calmodulin and a peptide derived from Munc13, (2) an N-terminal -laminin fragment, and (3) the complex between guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 and a peptide derived from retinal guanylyl cyclase. We show that the StavroX software is advantageous for analyzing crosslinked products due to its easy-to-use graphical user interface and the highly automated analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data resulting in short times for analysis. StavroX is expected to give a further push to the chemical crosslinking approach as a routine technique for protein interaction studies. © 2011 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.","title":"StavroX-A software for analyzing crosslinked products in protein interaction studies","authors":[{"name":"Gotze M."},{"name":"Pettelkau J."},{"name":"Schaks S."},{"name":"Bosse K."},{"name":"Ihling C.H."},{"name":"Krauth F."},{"name":"Fritzsche R."},{"name":"Kuhn U."},{"name":"Sinz A."}]},"pmid":"22038510","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"},{"term":"Protein structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-2324","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Michael Götze","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Goetze","email":"mgoetze@ethz.ch","typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools","stavrox"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://www.stavrox.com/qug.htm"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:stavrox","biotoolsID":"stavrox","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T13:10:09Z","name":"StavroX","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:43Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.stavrox.com/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"BLAST sequence similarity search (blastp or tblastn) against UniProtKB or taxonomic subdivisions, complete proteomes, UniRef, PDB, EMBL, ESTs","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"blast","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence search results","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0857"},"format":[]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2044"},"format":[]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Sequence similarity search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0346"},{"term":"Sequence alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"ExPASy helpdesk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.expasy.org/support","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"admin","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://web.expasy.org/blast/blast+_help.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web API","Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:blast_sib","biotoolsID":"blast_sib","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:39:04Z","name":"BLAST (SIB)","topic":[{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"},{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"}],"additionDate":"2017-12-06T18:14:21Z","collectionID":["BLAST","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://web.expasy.org/blast/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"VenomZone is a free web resource that provides information on venoms from six animal taxa (snakes, scorpions, spiders, cone snails, sea anemones and insects), as well as on their targets.

KGaA, Weinheim. Democratization of genomics technologies has enabled the rapid determination of genotypes. More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.","title":"Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible proteomics informatics","authors":[{"name":"Deutsch E.W."},{"name":"Mendoza L."},{"name":"Shteynberg D."},{"name":"Slagel J."},{"name":"Sun Z."},{"name":"Moritz R.L."}]},"pmid":"25631240","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":80,"date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","abstract":"Mass spectrometry has quickly become an essential tool in molecular biology laboratories.

In a straightforward manner, users can extract MS/MS information from raw data of many instrument formats, submit them to search engines for peptide identification, validate the results to remove false hits, combine together results of multiple search engines, infer sample proteins that gave rise to the identified peptides, and perform quantitation at the peptide and protein levels.","title":"Software pipeline and data analysis for MS/MS proteomics: the trans-proteomic pipeline.","authors":[{"name":"Keller A."},{"name":"Shteynberg D."}]},"pmid":"21082435","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":428,"date":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"The Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) is a suite of software tools for the analysis of MS/MS data sets.

KGaA, Weinheim Purpose: PepSweetener is a web-based visualization tool designed to facilitate the manual annotation of intact glycopeptides from MS data regardless of the instrument that produced these data. Experimental design: This exploratory tool uses a theoretical glycopeptide dataset to visualize all peptide-glycan combinations that fall within the error range of the query precursor ion. PepSweetener simplifies the determination of the correct peptide and glycan composition of a glycopeptide based on its precursor mass. The theoretical glycopeptide search space can be customized in an advanced query mode that specifies potential proteins/peptides, glycan compositions, and several experimental parameters. Results: PepSweetener displays the results on an interactive heat-map chart where theoretical glycopeptide tile colors correspond to ppm deviations from the query precursor mass. Additionally, a visualization chart incorporates glycan composition filtering, sorting by mass and tolerance, and an in silico peptide fragmentation diagram is provided to further support the correct glycopeptide identification. Conclusions and clinical relevance: PepSweetener efficiently allows the selection of the most probable intact glycopeptide mass matches and speeds up the verification process. It is validated on serum protein samples and immunoglobulins.

One had both continuous and papillary deposits within a single section. There was no difference in the incidence or quantity of immunoglobulin and C3 between the elbow, forearm and thigh. There was observed to be a diminution in quantity of IgA and incidence of C3 in patients taking a gluten\u2010free diet.

A profile is a table of posi\u2010tion\u2010specific scores and gap penalties, providing a generalized description of a protein motif, which can be used for sequence alignments and database searches instead of an individual sequence. A sequence profile is derived from a multiple sequence alignment. We have found 2 ways to improve the sensitivity of sequence profiles: (1) Sequence weights: Usage of individual weights for each sequence avoids bias toward closely related sequences. These weights are automatically assigned based on the distance of the sequences using a published procedure (Sib\u2010bald PR, Argos P, 1990, J Mol Biol 216:813\u2010818). (2) Amino acid substitution table: In addition to the alignment, the construction of a profile also needs an amino acid substitution table. We have found that in some cases a new table, the BLOSUM45 table (Henikoff S, Henikoff JG, 1992, Proc Natl Acud Sci USA 89:10915\u201010919), is more sensitive than the original Dayhoff table or the modified Dayhoff table used in the current implementation. Profiles derived by the improved method are more sensitive and selective in a number of cases where previous methods have failed to completely separate true members from false positives.

Many of the predictive methods are based either on a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) of fixed length or on a windowless Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The performance of the two approaches is tested for Coiled-Coil Domains (CCDs). The prediction of CCDs is used frequently, and its optimization seems worthwhile. Results: We have conceived MARCOIL, an HMM for the recognition of proteins with a CCD on a genomic scale. A cross-validated study suggests that MARCOIL improves predictions compared to the traditional PSSM algorithm, especially for some protein families and for short CCDs. The study was designed to reveal differences inherent in the two methods. Potential confounding factors such as differences in the dimension of parameter space and in the parameter values were avoided by using the same amino acid propensities and by keeping the transition probabilities of the HMM constant during cross-validation.","title":"An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions","authors":[{"name":"Delorenzi M."},{"name":"Speed T."}]},"pmid":"12016059","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/18.4.617"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Prediction and recognition","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Mauro Delorenzi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"mauro.delorenzi@isrec.ch","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"admin","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://bcf.isb-sib.ch/webmarcoil/webmarcoilINFOC1.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:marcoil","biotoolsID":"marcoil","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:38:54Z","name":"MARCOIL","topic":[{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"},{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0081"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Protein secondary structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3542"}],"additionDate":"2017-12-06T18:14:41Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bcf.isb-sib.ch/webmarcoil/webmarcoilINFOC1.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"MSight: An image analysis software for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Isobaric labeling techniques utilize MS/MS spectra for relative quantification, which can be either based on the relative intensities of reporter ions in the low mass region (iTRAQ and TMT) or on the relative intensities of quantification signatures throughout the spectrum due to isobaric peptide termini labeling (IPTL). Due to the increased quantitative information found in MS/MS fragment spectra generated by the recently developed IPTL approach, new software was required to extract the quantitative information. IsobariQ was specifically developed for this purpose; however, support for the reporter ion techniques iTRAQ and TMT is also included. In addition, to address recently emphasized issues about heterogeneity of variance in proteomics data sets, IsobariQ employs the statistical software package R and variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) algorithms available therein. Finally, the functionality of IsobariQ is validated with data sets of experiments using 6-plex TMT and IPTL. Notably, protein substrates resulting from cleavage by proteases can be identified as shown for caspase targets in apoptosis. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","title":"IsobariQ: Software for isobaric quantitative proteomics using IPTL, iTRAQ, and TMT","authors":[{"name":"Arntzen M.O."},{"name":"Koehler C.J."},{"name":"Barsnes H."},{"name":"Berven F.S."},{"name":"Treumann A."},{"name":"Thiede B."}]},"pmid":"21067241","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"Mascot .dat file","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3713"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"TMT-tag","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3641"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Standardisation and normalisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"},{"term":"iTRAQ","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3639"},{"term":"Isotope-coded protein label","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3705"},{"term":"Quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"},{"term":"Labeled quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3635"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"see publication","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"magnus.arntzen@biotek.uio.no","typeRole":["Maintainer"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"admin","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:IsobariQ","biotoolsID":"IsobariQ","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:38:53Z","name":"IsobariQ","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2019-02-20T16:17:10Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://norwegian-proteomics-society.uio.no/isobariq/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"InfernoRDN can perform various downstream data analysis, data reduction, and data comparison tasks including normalization, hypothesis testing, clustering, and heatmap generation.","language":["R","C#"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/InfernoRDN"},{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/InfernoRDN"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":242,"date":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Summary: Data Analysis Tool Extension (DAnTE) is a statistical tool designed to address challenges associated with quantitative bottom-up, shotgun proteomics data.

Resource description framework (RDF) and Property Graph databases are emerging technologies that are used for storing graph-structured data.We compare these technologies through a molecular biology use case: glycan substructure search. Glycans are branched tree-like molecules composed of building blocks linked together by chemical bonds. The molecular structure of a glycan can be encoded into a direct acyclic graph where each node represents a building block and each edge serves as a chemical linkage between two building blocks. In this context, Graph databases are possible software solutions for storing glycan structures and Graph query languages, such as SPARQL and Cypher, can be used to perform a substructure search. Glycan substructure searching is an important feature for querying structure and experimental glycan databases and retrieving biologically meaningful data. This applies for example to identifying a region of the glycan recognised by a glycan binding protein (GBP). In this study, 19,404 glycan structures were selected from GlycomeDB (www.glycome-db.org) and modelled for being stored into a RDF triple store and a Property Graph.We then performed two different sets of searches and compared the query response times and the results from both technologies to assess performance and accuracy. The two implementations produced the same results, but interestingly we noted a difference in the query response times. Qualitative measures such as portability were also used to define further criteria for choosing the technology adapted to solving glycan substructure search and other comparable issues.","title":"Property Graph vs RDF triple store: A comparison on glycan substructure search","authors":[{"name":"Alocci D."},{"name":"Mariethoz J."},{"name":"Horlacher O."},{"name":"Bolleman J.T."},{"name":"Campbell M.P."},{"name":"Lisacek F."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0144578"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Variant pattern analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3504"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"ExPASy helpdesk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.expasy.org/support","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"admin","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://glycoproteome.expasy.org/substructuresearch/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:glys3","biotoolsID":"glys3","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:38:48Z","name":"GlyS3","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-12-06T18:14:31Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://glycoproteome.expasy.org/substructuresearch"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Web interface to upload, visualize and interactively compare glycan expression profiles.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Nowadays, due to the advance of experimental techniques in glycomics, large collections of glycan profiles are regularly published. The rapid growth of available glycan data accentuates the lack of innovative tools for visualizing and exploring large amount of information. Scientists resort to using general-purpose spreadsheet applications to create ad hoc data visualization. Thus, results end up being encoded in publication images and text, while valuable curated data is stored in files as supplementary information. To tackle this problem, we have built an interactive pipeline composed with three tools: Glynsight, EpitopeXtractor and Glydin'. Glycan profile data can be imported in Glynsight, which generates a custom interactive glycan profile. Several profiles can be compared and glycan composition is integrated with structural data stored in databases. Glycan structures of interest can then be sent to EpitopeXtractor to perform a glycoepitope extraction. EpitopeXtractor results can be superimposed on the Glydin' glycoepitope network.

Essentially, a sequence that includes possible transmembrane regions is compared in a second step with TM segments in a sequence library of documented transmembrane proteins. If the performance of the query sequence against the library of documented TM segment-containing sequences in this test is lower than an empirical threshold, it is classified as a non-transmembrane protein. The probability of false positive prediction for trusted TM region hits is expressed in terms of E-values. The modified DAS method, the DAS-TMfilter algorithm, has an unchanged high sensitivity for TM segments (∼95% detected in a learning set of 128 documented transmembrane proteins). At the same time, the selectivity measured over a non-redundant set of 526 soluble proteins with known 3D structure is ∼99%, mainly because a large number of falsely predicted single membrane-pass

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.","title":"Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Perkins D.N."},{"name":"Pappin D.J.C."},{"name":"Creasy D.M."},{"name":"Cottrell J.S."}]},"pmid":"10612281","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":192,"date":"2002-10-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"An error tolerant mode for database matching of uninterpreted tandem mass spectrometry data is described.

OpenSWATH is popular open-source software for peptide identification and quantification from SWATH-MS data. For downstream statistical and quantitative analysis there exist different tools such as MSstats, mapDIA and aLFQ. However, the transfer of data from OpenSWATH to the downstream statistical tools is currently technically challenging. Here we introduce the R/Bioconductor package SWATH2stats, which allows convenient processing of the data into a format directly readable by the downstream analysis tools. In addition, SWATH2stats allows annotation, analyzing the variation and the reproducibility of the measurements, FDR estimation, and advanced filtering before submitting the processed data to downstream tools. These functionalities are important to quickly analyze the quality of the SWATH-MS data. Hence, SWATH2stats is a new open-source tool that summarizes several practical functionalities for analyzing, processing, and converting SWATH-MS data and thus facilitates the efficient analysis of large-scale SWATH/DIA datasets.","title":"SWATH2stats: An R/bioconductor package to process and convert quantitative SWATH-MS proteomics data for downstream analysis tools","authors":[{"name":"Blattmann P."},{"name":"Heusel M."},{"name":"Aebersold R."}]},"pmid":"27054327","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC4824525","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0153160"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Processed microarray data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3111"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"},{"term":"Matrix format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3033"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Raw microarray data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3110"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9105-6381","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Peter Blattmann","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"blattmann@imsb.biol.ethz.ch","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"peterb","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SWATH2stats.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.4.1"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:swath2stats","biotoolsID":"swath2stats","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:48:19Z","name":"SWATH2stats","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:58:36Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SWATH2stats.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/DominoEffect/"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/DominoEffect"}],"description":"The functions support identification and annotation of hotspot residues in proteins.

Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseCancer genome sequencing has shown that driver genes can often be distinguished not only by the elevated mutation frequency but also by specific nucleotide positions that accumulate changes at a high rate. However, properties associated with a residue's potential to drive tumorigenesis when mutated have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, using a novel methodological approach, we identify and characterize a compendium of 180 hotspot residues within 160 human proteins which occur with a significant frequency and are likely to have functionally relevant impact. We find that such mutations (i) are more prominent in proteins that can exist in the on and off state, (ii) reflect the identity of a tumor of origin, and (iii) often localize within interfaces which mediate interactions with other proteins or ligands. Following, we further examine structural data for human protein complexes and identify a number of additional protein interfaces that accumulate cancer mutations at a high rate. Jointly, these analyses suggest that disruption and dysregulation of protein interactions can be instrumental in switching functions of cancer proteins and activating downstream changes.","title":"Systematic characterization of pan-cancer mutation clusters","authors":[{"name":"Buljan M."},{"name":"Blattmann P."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Boutros M."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.15252/msb.20177974"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2928"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Sequence comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2451"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Marija Buljan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"marija.buljan.2@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Peter Blattmann","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"blattmann@imsb.biol.ethz.ch","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"peterb","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/DominoEffect/man/DominoEffect.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dominoeffect","biotoolsID":"dominoeffect","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:47:36Z","name":"DominoEffect","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3168"},{"term":"Genetic variation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0199"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-08T13:52:11Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DominoEffect.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/PowerExplorer/"},{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://gitlab.utu.fi/CompBioMedNGSTools/PowerExplorer"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/PowerExplorer"}],"description":"Estimate and predict power among groups and multiple sample sizes with simulated data, the simulations are operated based on distribution parameters estimated from the provided input dataset.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"mass","type":"uses"},{"biotoolsID":"biobase","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/PowerExplorer_1.0.1.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Differential protein expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3741"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2424"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Xu Qiao","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"xu.qiao@utu.fi","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools","suomtomi"]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/PowerExplorer/man/PowerExplorer.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.1"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:powerexplorer","biotoolsID":"powerexplorer","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:45:48Z","name":"PowerExplorer","topic":[{"term":"ChIP-seq","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3169"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"RNA-seq","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3170"},{"term":"Sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3168"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-12T14:28:05Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PowerExplorer.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Perform metagenomic data retrieval and functional annotation retrieval.

The algorithm is simple, easy to understand, highly accurate, fast, and memory-efficient. The method is based on the application of the Newton-Girard theorem and Viète's formulae to the polynomial coding of different aggregated isotopic variants. As a result, an elegant recursive equation is obtained for computing the occurrence probabilities of consecutive aggregated isotopic peaks. Additionally, the algorithm also allows calculating the center-masses of the aggregated isotopic variants. We propose an implementation which is suitable for high-throughput processing and easily customizable for application in different areas of mass spectral data analyses. A case study demonstrates how the R-package can be applied in the context of protein research, but the software can be also used for calculating the isotopic distribution in the context of lipidomics, metabolomics, glycoscience, or even space exploration.

A given number of samples must be analysed in order to detect clinically relevant differences between cancers and controls, with adequate statistical power. From clinical proteomic profiling studies, expression data for each peak (protein or peptide) from two or more clinically defined groups of subjects are typically available. Typically, both exposure and confounder information on each subject are also available, and usually the samples are not from randomized subjects. Moreover, the data is usually available in replicate. At the design stage, however, covariates are not typically available and are often ignored in sample size calculations. This leads to the use of insufficient numbers of samples and reduced power when there are imbalances in the numbers of subjects between different phenotypic groups. A method is proposed for accommodating information on covariates, data imbalances and designcharacteristics, such as the technical replication and the observational nature of these studies, in sample size calculations. It assumes knowledge of a joint distribution for the protein expression values and the covariates. When discretized covariates are considered, the effect of the covariates enters the calculations as a function of the proportions of subjects with specific attributes. This makes it relatively straightforward (even when pilot data on subject covariates is unavailable) to specify and to adjust for the effect of the expected heterogeneities. The new method suggests certain experimental designs which lead to the use of a smaller number of samples when planning a study. Analysis of data from the proteomic profiling of colorectal cancer reveals that fewer samples are needed when a study is balanced than when it is unbalanced, and when the IMAC30 chip-type is used.

Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment, particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across the growing season over different spatial scales (R 2 = 0.73, 0.77, and 0.86 at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P < 0.0001). We developed a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with flux tower observations of GPP (R 2 = 0.68; P < 0.0001), demonstrating the potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf F q \u2019/F m \u2019, the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer, was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield (SIF/APAR, R 2 = 0.79; P < 0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived GPP (GPP SIF ) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy structure, including chlorophyll content (R 2 = 0.65 for canopy GPP SIF and chlorophyll content; P < 0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R 2 = 0.35 for canopy GPP SIF and LAI; P < 0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R 2 = 0.36 for canopy GPP SIF and NDVI; P < 0.0001). Our results suggest that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales.","title":"Chlorophyll fluorescence tracks seasonal variations of photosynthesis from leaf to canopy in a temperate forest","authors":[{"name":"Yang H."},{"name":"Yang X."},{"name":"Zhang Y."},{"name":"Heskel M.A."},{"name":"Lu X."},{"name":"Munger J.W."},{"name":"Sun S."},{"name":"Tang J."}]},"pmid":"27976474","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1111/gcb.13590"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Samuel Wieczorek","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"samuel.wieczorek@cea.fr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DAPAR.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.6.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dapar","biotoolsID":"dapar","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:38:24Z","name":"DAPAR","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:01:21Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DAPAR.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A toolset for deciphering and managing biological sequences.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"xvector","type":"uses"},{"biotoolsID":"s4vectors","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/DECIPHER_2.2.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":782,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment\u2013mass spectrometry (ubIa-Ms), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. one major strength of ubIa-Ms is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (ptMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, ubIa-Ms uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DuBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for ubIa-Ms that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (lc)\u2013Ms/Ms analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. the computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source r software package, including a graphical interface. typically, ubIa-Ms allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. the nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.","title":"Proteome-wide identification of ubiquitin interactions using UbIA-MS","authors":[{"name":"Zhang X."},{"name":"Smits A.H."},{"name":"Van Tilburg G.B.A."},{"name":"Ovaa H."},{"name":"Huber W."},{"name":"Vermeulen M."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nprot.2017.147"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Differential gene expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Arne Smits","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"smits.arne@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/DEP/man/DEP.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dep","biotoolsID":"dep","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:35:53Z","name":"DEP","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-08T11:47:26Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEP.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt/issues"},{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/diffcyt/"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/diffcyt"}],"description":"Statistical methods for differential discovery analyses in high-dimensional cytometry data (including flow cytometry, mass cytometry or CyTOF, and oligonucleotide-tagged cytometry), based on (i) high-resolution clustering and (ii) empirical Bayes moderated tests adapted from transcriptomics.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"s4vectors","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/diffcyt_1.0.6.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/349738"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Clustering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Lukas M.

Software packages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these data. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing. Results: We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments. Conclusions: IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices.

However, MS-GF+ provides few statistical estimates about the peptide-spectrum matches, hence limiting the biological interpretation. Here, we enabled Percolator processing for MS-GF+ output and observed an increased number of identified peptides for a wide variety of data sets. In addition, Percolator directly reports p values and false discovery rate estimates, such as q values and posterior error probabilities, for peptide-spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins, functions that are useful for the whole proteomics community. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","title":"Fast and accurate database searches with MS-GF+percolator","authors":[{"name":"Granholm V."},{"name":"Kim S."},{"name":"Navarro J.C.F."},{"name":"Sjolund E."},{"name":"Smith R.D."},{"name":"Kall L."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/pr400937n"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Thomas Lin Pedersen","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"thomasp85@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSGFplus.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.8.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msgfplus","biotoolsID":"msgfplus","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:16:24Z","name":"MSGFplus","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0108"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:04:48Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSGFplus.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Exploratory data analysis to assess the quality of a set of LC-MS/MS experiments, and visualize de influence of the involved factors.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"msnbase","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/msmsEDA_1.12.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":782,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

An important objective of SRM is to obtain peptide quantifications that are (1) suitable for the investigation, and (2) reproducible across laboratories and runs. The first objective is achieved by system suitability tests (SST), which verify that mass spectrometric instrumentation performs as specified. The second objective is achieved by quality control (QC), which provides in-process quality assurance of the sample profile. A common aspect of SST and QC is the longitudinal nature of the data. Although SST and QC have received a lot of attention in the proteomic community, the currently used statistical methods are limited. This manuscript improves upon the statistical methodology for SST and QC that is currently used in proteomics. It adapts the modern methods of longitudinal statistical process control, such as simultaneous and time weighted control charts and change point analysis, to SST and QC of SRM experiments, discusses their advantages, and provides practical guidelines. Evaluations on simulated data sets, and on data sets from the Clinical Proteomics Technology Assessment for Cancer (CPTAC) consortium, demonstrated that these methods substantially improve our ability of real time monitoring, early detection and prevention of chromatographic and instrumental problems. We implemented the methods in an open-source R-based software package MSstatsQC and its web-based graphical user interface. They are available for use stand-alone, or for integration with automated pipelines. Although the examples focus on targeted proteomics, the statistical methods in this manuscript apply more generally to quantitative proteomics.","title":"MSstatsQC: Longitudinal system suitability monitoring and quality control for targeted proteomic experiments","authors":[{"name":"Dogu E."},{"name":"Mohammad-Taheri S."},{"name":"Abbatiello S.E."},{"name":"Bereman M.S."},{"name":"MacLean B."},{"name":"Schilling B."},{"name":"Vitek O."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1074/mcp.M116.064774"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Eralp Dogu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"eralp.dogu@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/MSstatsQC/man/MSstatsQC.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msstatsqc","biotoolsID":"msstatsqc","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T17:11:05Z","name":"MSstatsQC","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-11T13:33:05Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstatsQC.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/sneumann/mzR/"}],"description":"Provides a unified API to the common file formats and parsers available for mass spectrometry data.

Obviously, this strategy could not identify peptide and protein sequences that are absent from a reference database. A customized protein database on the basis of RNA-Seq data is thus proposed to assist with and improve the identification of novel peptides. Correspondingly, development of a comprehensive pipeline, which provides an end-to-end solution for novel peptide detection with the customized protein database, is necessary. Results: A pipeline with an R package, assigned as a PGA utility, was developed that enables automated treatment to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data acquired from different MS platforms and construction of customized protein databases based on RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome guide. Hence, PGA can identify novel peptides and generate an HTML-based report with a visualized interface. On the basis of a published dataset, PGA was employed to identify peptides, resulting in 636 novel peptides, including 510 single amino acid polymorphism (SAP) peptides, 2 INDEL peptides, 49 splice junction peptides, and 75 novel transcript-derived peptides. The software is freely available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/PGA/ , and the example reports are available at http://wenbostar.github.io/PGA/. Conclusions: The pipeline of PGA, aimed at being platform-independent and easy-to-use, was successfully developed and shown to be capable of identifying novel peptides by searching the customized protein database derived from RNA-Seq data.","title":"PGA: An R/Bioconductor package for identification of novel peptides using a customized database derived from RNA-Seq","authors":[{"name":"Wen B."},{"name":"Xu S."},{"name":"Zhou R."},{"name":"Zhang B."},{"name":"Wang X."},{"name":"Liu X."},{"name":"Xu X."},{"name":"Liu S."}]},"pmid":"27316337","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC4912784","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-016-1133-3"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2886"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence alignment (nucleic acid)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1383"},"format":[{"term":"BED","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3003"},{"term":"VCF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3016"},{"term":"GTF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2306"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Deposition","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3431"},{"term":"RNA-Seq analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3680"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2261-3150","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Bo Wen","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"wenbo@genomics.cn","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Shaohang Xu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"xsh.skye@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PGA.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.4.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pga","biotoolsID":"pga","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-20T16:57:00Z","name":"PGA","topic":[{"term":"RNA-seq","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3170"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Database management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3489"},{"term":"Data integration and warehousing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3366"},{"term":"Data submission, annotation and curation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0219"},{"term":"Data governance","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3571"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:56:33Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PGA.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://www.genopolis.it"}],"description":"The Power Law Global Error Model has been shown to faithfully model the variance-versus-mean dependence that exists in a variety of genome-wide datasets, including microarray and proteomics data.

Methods for the identification of these so-called \"differentially expressed genes\" (DEG) would largely benefit from a deeper knowledge of the intrinsic measurement variability. Though it is clear that variance of repeated measures is highly dependent on the average expression level of a given gene, there is still a lack of consensus on how signal reproducibility is linked to signal intensity. The aim of this study was to empirically model the variance versus mean dependence in microarray data to improve the performance of existing methods for identifying DEG. Results: In the present work we used data generated by our lab as well as publicly available data sets to show that dispersion of repeated measures depends on location of the measures themselves following a power law. This enables us to construct a power law global error model (PLGEM) that is applicable to various Affymetrix GeneChip data sets. A new DEG identification method is therefore proposed, consisting of a statistic designed to make explicit use of model-derived measurement spread estimates and a resampling-based hypothesis testing algorithm. Conclusions: The new method provides a control of the false positive rate, a good sensitivity vs. specificity trade-off and consistent results with varying number of replicates and even using single samples. © 2004 Pavelka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"A power law global error model for the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray data","authors":[{"name":"Pavelka N."},{"name":"Pelizzola M."},{"name":"Vizzardelli C."},{"name":"Capozzoli M."},{"name":"Splendiani A."},{"name":"Granucci F."},{"name":"Ricciardi-Castagnoli P."}]},"pmid":"15606915","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC545082","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-5-203"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4542-9970","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Norman Pavelka","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"normanpavelka@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/plgem.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.46.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:plgem","biotoolsID":"plgem","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T20:06:19Z","name":"plgem","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Microarray experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3518"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:02:32Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/plgem.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"The Probe Logarithmic Error Intensity Estimate method produces an improved signal by accounting for experimentally observed patterns in probe behavior and handling error at the appropriately at low and high signal values.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"biobase","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/plier_1.44.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":782,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

To facilitate genome-based representation and analysis of proteomics data, we developed a new bioinformatics framework, proBAMsuite, in which a central component is the protein BAM (proBAM) file format for organizing peptide spectrum matches (PSMs)1 within the context of the genome. proBAMsuite also includes two R packages, pro-BAMr and proBAMtools, for generating and analyzing pro-BAM files, respectively. Applying proBAMsuite to three recently published proteomics datasets, we demonstrated its utility in facilitating efficient genome-based sharing, interpretation, and integration of proteomics data. First, the interpretation of proteomics data is significantly enhanced with the rich genomic annotation information. Second, PSMs can be easily reannotated using user-specified gene annotation schemes and assembled into both protein and gene identifications. Third, using the genome as a common reference, proBAMsuite facilitates seamless proteomics and proteogenomics data integration. Finally, proBAM files can be readily visualized in genome browsers and thus bring proteomics data analysis to a general audience beyond the proteomics community.

Proteomics provides a critical data source for such models, but currently lacks robust de novo methods for network construction, which could bring important insights in systems biology.Results: We have evaluated the construction of network models using methods derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We show that approximately scale-free peptide networks, composed of statistically significant modules, are feasible and biologically meaningful using two mouse lung experiments and one human plasma experiment. Within each network, peptides derived from the same protein are shown to have a statistically higher topological overlap and concordance in abundance, which is potentially important for inferring protein abundance. The module representatives, called eigenpeptides, correlate significantly with biological phenotypes. Furthermore, within modules, we find significant enrichment for biological function and known interactions (gene ontology and protein-protein interactions).Conclusions: Biological networks are important tools in the analysis of complex systems. In this paper we evaluate the application of weighted co-expression network analysis to quantitative proteomics data. Protein co-expression networks allow novel approaches for biological interpretation, quality control, inference of protein abundance, a framework for potentially resolving degenerate peptide-protein mappings, and a biomarker signature discovery. © 2013 Gibbs et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Protein co-expression network analysis (ProCoNA)","authors":[{"name":"Gibbs D.L."},{"name":"Baratt A."},{"name":"Baric R.S."},{"name":"Kawaoka Y."},{"name":"Smith R.D."},{"name":"Orwoll E.S."},{"name":"Katze M.G."},{"name":"McWeeney S.K."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/2043-9113-3-11"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Pathway or network","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2600"},"format":[{"term":"PDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3508"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"},{"term":"Pathway or network visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"David L Gibbs","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"gibbsd@ohsu.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ProCoNA.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.12.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:procona","biotoolsID":"procona","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T20:00:42Z","name":"ProCoNA","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Protein expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0108"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:56:38Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ProCoNA.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/lgatto/pRoloc"}],"description":"Pattern recognition techniques on quantitiative mass spectrometry data to infer protein sub-cellular localisation.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"biobase","type":"uses"},{"biotoolsID":"biomart","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/pRoloc_1.14.5.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":21,"date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","abstract":"© 2016 Breckels et al.Sub-cellular localisation of proteins is an essential post-translational regulatory mechanism that can be assayed using high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS).

We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms through evaluation of five experimental datasets, from four different species in conjunction with four different auxiliary data sources to classify proteins to tens of sub-cellular compartments with high generalisation accuracy. We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome.

We apply hyperLOPIT to a pluripotent stem cell population whose subcellular proteome has not been extensively studied. We provide localization data on over 5,000 proteins with unprecedented spatial resolution to reveal the organization of organelles, sub-organellar compartments, protein complexes, functional networks and steady-state dynamics of proteins and unexpected subcellular locations.

Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment, particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across the growing season over different spatial scales (R 2 = 0.73, 0.77, and 0.86 at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P < 0.0001). We developed a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with flux tower observations of GPP (R 2 = 0.68; P < 0.0001), demonstrating the potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf F q \u2019/F m \u2019, the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer, was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield (SIF/APAR, R 2 = 0.79; P < 0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived GPP (GPP SIF ) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy structure, including chlorophyll content (R 2 = 0.65 for canopy GPP SIF and chlorophyll content; P < 0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R 2 = 0.35 for canopy GPP SIF and LAI; P < 0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R 2 = 0.36 for canopy GPP SIF and NDVI; P < 0.0001). Our results suggest that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales.","title":"Chlorophyll fluorescence tracks seasonal variations of photosynthesis from leaf to canopy in a temperate forest","authors":[{"name":"Yang H."},{"name":"Yang X."},{"name":"Zhang Y."},{"name":"Heskel M.A."},{"name":"Lu X."},{"name":"Munger J.W."},{"name":"Sun S."},{"name":"Tang J."}]},"pmid":"27976474","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1111/gcb.13590"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Differential gene expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Samuel Wieczorek","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"samuel.wieczorek@cea.fr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Prostar.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.6.1"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:prostar","biotoolsID":"prostar","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T19:54:17Z","name":"Prostar","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:04:22Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Prostar.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/lgatto/ProteomicsAnnotationHubData"}],"description":"These recipes convert a variety and a growing number of public proteomics data sets into easily-used standard BioConductor data structures.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"BiocStyle","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/ProteomicsAnnotationHubData_1.4.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":782,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

We discuss the principal computational tools for quality control and list their main characteristics and applicability. As most of these tools have specific use cases, it is not straightforward to compare their performances. For this survey, we used different sets of quality control metrics derived from information at various stages in a mass spectrometry process and evaluated their effectiveness at capturing qualitative information about an experiment using a supervised learning approach.

Here, we introduce rMSI, an R package for MSI data analysis focused on providing an efficient way to manage MSI data together with a GUI integrated in R environment. MS data is loaded in rMSI custom format optimized to minimize the memory footprint yet maintaining a fast spectra access. The rMSI GUI is designed for simple and effective data exploration and visualization. Moreover, rMSI is designed to be integrated in the R environment through a library of functions that can be used to share MS data across others R packages. The release of rMSI for R environment establishes a novel and flexible platform for MSI data analysis, completely free and open-source.","title":"RMSI: An R package for MS imaging data handling and visualization","authors":[{"name":"Rafols P."},{"name":"Torres S."},{"name":"Ramirez N."},{"name":"Del Castillo E."},{"name":"Yanes O."},{"name":"Brezmes J."},{"name":"Correig X."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx182"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Image analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jesús Brezmes","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jesus.brezmes@urv.cat","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/prafols/rMSI"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rmsi","biotoolsID":"rmsi","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T17:55:40Z","name":"rMSI","topic":[{"term":"Biological imaging","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3383"},{"term":"Medical imaging","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3384"},{"term":"Mass spectrometry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2018-06-06T19:24:24Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/prafols/rMSI"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/lgatto/rpx"}],"description":"This package implements an interface to proteomics data submitted to the ProteomeXchange consortium.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"MSnbase","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/rpx_1.10.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":1494,"date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","abstract":"","title":"ProteomeXchange provides globally coordinated proteomics data submission and dissemination","authors":[{"name":"Vizcaino J.A."},{"name":"Deutsch E.W."},{"name":"Wang R."},{"name":"Csordas A."},{"name":"Reisinger F."},{"name":"Rios D."},{"name":"Dianes J.A."},{"name":"Sun Z."},{"name":"Farrah T."},{"name":"Bandeira N."},{"name":"Binz P.-A."},{"name":"Xenarios I."},{"name":"Eisenacher M."},{"name":"Mayer G."},{"name":"Gatto L."},{"name":"Campos A."},{"name":"Chalkley R.J."},{"name":"Kraus H.-J."},{"name":"Albar J.P."},{"name":"Martinez-Bartolome S."},{"name":"Apweiler R."},{"name":"Omenn G.S."},{"name":"Martens L."},{"name":"Jones A.R."},{"name":"Hermjakob H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nbt.2839"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Query and retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Laurent Gatto","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"lg390@cam.ac.uk","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rpx.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.10.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rpx","biotoolsID":"rpx","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T17:53:00Z","name":"rpx","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:01:39Z","collectionID":["BioConductor","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rpx.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Tool developed to automate (1) variation-associated database construction, (2) database searching, (3) post-processing, (4) HTML-based report generation in shotgun proteomics.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"rTandem","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/sapFinder_1.12.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":14,"date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"© The Author 2014.

KGaA, Weinheim. The integration of a protein's structure with its known sequence variation provides insight on how that protein evolves, for instance in terms of (changing) function or immunogenicity. Yet, collating the corresponding sequence variants into a multiple sequence alignment, calculating each position's conservation, and mapping this information back onto a relevant structure is not straightforward. We therefore built the Sequence Conservation on Protein 3D structure (scop3D) tool to perform these tasks automatically. The output consists of two modified PDB files in which the B-values for each position are replaced by the percentage sequence conservation, or the information entropy for each position, respectively. Furthermore, text files with absolute and relative amino acid occurrences for each position are also provided, along with snapshots of the protein from six distinct directions in space.

Summary Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the favored method for untargeted metabolomic analysis of small molecules in biofluids. Here we present SimExTargId, an open-source R package for autonomous analysis of metabolomic data and real-time observation of experimental runs. This simultaneous, fully automated and multi-threaded (optional) package is a wrapper for vendor-independent format conversion (ProteoWizard), xcms- and CAMERA- based peak-picking, MetMSLine-based pre-processing and covariate-based statistical analysis. Users are notified of detrimental instrument drift or errors by email. Also included are two shiny applications, targetId for real-time MS2 target identification, and peakMonitor to monitor targeted metabolites. Availability and implementation SimExTargId is publicly available under GNU LGPL v3.0 license at https://github.com/JosieLHayes/simExTargId, which includes a vignette with example data. SimExTargId should be installed on a dedicated data-processing workstation or server that is networked to the LC-MS platform to facilitate MS1 profiling of metabolomic data. Supplementary informationSupplementary dataare available at Bioinformatics online.","title":"SimExTargId: A comprehensive package for real-time LC-MS data acquisition and analysis","authors":[{"name":"Edmands W.M.B."},{"name":"Hayes J."},{"name":"Rappaport S.M."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty218"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Loading","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_1812"},{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Josie Hayes","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"josie.hayes@berkeley.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WMBEdmands/simExTargId/master/inst/doc/simExTargId.html?token=AEhLqF0JIrgmE2ZmDRN_eU0RjbhV8kYYks5ZRC8twA%3D%3D"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:simextargid","biotoolsID":"simextargid","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T17:41:52Z","name":"SimExTargId","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Mass spectrometry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Structural biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_1317"},{"term":"Data acquisition","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3077"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-03T16:15:57Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/JosieLHayes/simExTargId"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Identifies clustering of somatic mutations in proteins via a simulation approach while considering the protein's tertiary structure.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/SpacePAC_1.12.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":15,"date":"2014-07-03T00:00:00Z","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"Background: Current research suggests that a small set of \" driver\" mutations are responsible for tumorigenesis while a larger body of \" passenger\" mutations occur in the tumor but do not progress the disease. Due to recent pharmacological successes in treating cancers caused by driver mutations, a variety of methodologies that attempt to identify such mutations have been developed. Based on the hypothesis that driver mutations tend to cluster in key regions of the protein, the development of cluster identification algorithms has become critical.Results: We have developed a novel methodology, SpacePAC (Spatial Protein Amino acid Clustering), that identifies mutational clustering by considering the protein tertiary structure directly in 3D space. By combining the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and the spatial information in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), SpacePAC is able to identify novel mutation clusters in many proteins such as FGFR3 and CHRM2. In addition, SpacePAC is better able to localize the most significant mutational hotspots as demonstrated in the cases of BRAF and ALK.

Statistical and computational tools are essential for the design and analysis of SRM experiments, particularly in studies with large sample throughput. Currently, most such tools focus on the selection of optimized transitions and on processing signals from SRM assays. Little attention is devoted to protein significance analysis, which combines the quantitative measurements for a protein across isotopic labels, peptides, charge states, transitions, samples, and conditions, and detects proteins that change in abundance between conditions while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose a statistical modeling framework for protein significance analysis. It is based on linear mixed-effects models and is applicable to most experimental designs for both isotope label-based and label-free SRM workflows. We illustrate the utility of the framework in two studies: one with a group comparison experimental design and the other with a time course experimental design. We further verify the accuracy of the framework in two controlled data sets, one from the NCI-CPTAC reproducibility investigation and the other from an in-house spike-in study. The proposed framework is sensitive and specific, produces accurate results in broad experimental circumstances, and helps to optimally design future SRM experiments. The statistical framework is implemented in an open-source R-based software package SRMstats, and can be used by researchers with a limited statistics background as a standalone tool or in integration with the existing computational pipelines. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","title":"Protein significance analysis in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) measurements","authors":[{"name":"Chang C.-Y."},{"name":"Picotti P."},{"name":"Huttenhain R."},{"name":"Heinzelmann-Schwarz V."},{"name":"Jovanovic M."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Vitek O."}]},"pmid":"22190732","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~ovitek/Home.html","email":"chang54@purdue.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chang54/SRMstats/R_implementation.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:srmstats","biotoolsID":"srmstats","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T17:39:57Z","name":"SRMstats","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T19:00:32Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chang54/SRMstats/Home.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/phosphonormalizer/"}],"description":"It uses the overlap between enriched and non-enriched datasets to compensate for the bias introduced in global phosphorylation after applying median normalization.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/phosphonormalizer_1.4.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"© The Author 2017.

Motivation Global centering-based normalization is a commonly used normalization approach in mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. It scales the peptide abundances to have the same median intensities, based on an assumption that the majority of abundances remain the same across the samples. However, especially in phosphoproteomics, this assumption can introduce bias, as the samples are enriched during sample preparation which can mask the underlying biological changes. To address this possible bias, phosphopeptides quantified in both enriched and non-enriched samples can be used to calculate factors that mitigate the bias.

Motivation: Current informatic techniques for processing raw chromatography/mass spectrometry data break down under several common, non-ideal conditions. Importantly, hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography (a key separation technology for metabolomics) produces data which are especially challenging to process. We identify three critical points of failure in current informatic workflows: compound specific drift, integration region variance, and naive missing value imputation. We implement the Warpgroup algorithm to address these challenges. Results: Warpgroup adds peak subregion detection, consensus integration bound detection, and intelligent missing value imputation steps to the conventional informatic workflow. When compared with the conventional workflow, Warpgroup made major improvements to the processed data. The coefficient of variation for peaks detected in replicate injections of a complex Escherichia Coli extract were halved (a reduction of 19%). Integration regions across samples were much more robust. Additionally, many signals lost by the conventional workflow were 'rescued' by the Warpgroup refinement, thereby resulting in greater analyte coverage in the processed data.

We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98% of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N in -C in topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N out -C in topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. © 2001 Academic Press.","title":"Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model: Application to complete genomes","authors":[{"name":"Krogh A."},{"name":"Larsson B."},{"name":"Von Heijne G."},{"name":"Sonnhammer E.L.L."}]},"pmid":"11152613","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1006/jmbi.2000.4315"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein features","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1277"},"format":[{"term":"GFF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2305"}]},{"data":{"term":"Sequence report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2955"},"format":[{"term":"Binary format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2333"}]}],"note":"Prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins","input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2044"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Transmembrane protein prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"CBS","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.bioinformatics.dtu.dk/english/Service/Contact","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5147-6282","typeEntity":null,"name":"Anders Krogh","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"akrogh@bio.ku.dk","typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools","veits@bmb.sdu.dk"]},"owner":"CBS","cost":"Free of charge (with restrictions)","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":["2.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Web application","Web service"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tmhmm","biotoolsID":"tmhmm","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-19T07:48:11Z","name":"TMHMM","topic":[{"term":"Membrane and lipoproteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0820"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Protein secondary structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3542"}],"additionDate":"2015-02-16T20:23:33Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Project within the HUPO Proteomics Standard Initiative (HUPO-PSI) that standardises programmatic access to molecular interaction databases.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/PSICQUIC_1.12.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":174,"date":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"","title":"PSICQUIC and PSISCORE: Accessing and scoring molecular interactions","authors":[{"name":"Aranda B."},{"name":"Blankenburg H."},{"name":"Kerrien S."},{"name":"Brinkman F.S.L."},{"name":"Ceol A."},{"name":"Chautard E."},{"name":"Dana J.M."},{"name":"De Las Rivas J."},{"name":"Dumousseau M."},{"name":"Galeota E."},{"name":"Gaulton A."},{"name":"Goll J."},{"name":"Hancock R.E.W."},{"name":"Isserlin R."},{"name":"Jimenez R.C."},{"name":"Kerssemakers J."},{"name":"Khadake J."},{"name":"Lynn D.J."},{"name":"Michaut M."},{"name":"O'Kelly G."},{"name":"Ono K."},{"name":"Orchard S."},{"name":"Prieto C."},{"name":"Razick S."},{"name":"Rigina O."},{"name":"Salwinski L."},{"name":"Simonovic M."},{"name":"Velankar S."},{"name":"Winter A."},{"name":"Wu G."},{"name":"Bader G.D."},{"name":"Cesareni G."},{"name":"Donaldson I.M."},{"name":"Eisenberg D."},{"name":"Kleywegt G.J."},{"name":"Overington J."},{"name":"Ricard-Blum S."},{"name":"Tyers M."},{"name":"Albrecht M."},{"name":"Hermjakob H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.1637"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":44,"date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nucleic acids research","abstract":"The Proteomics Standard Initiative Common QUery InterfaCe (PSICQUIC) specification was created by the Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) to enable computational access to molecular-interaction data resources by means of a standard Web Service and query language.

Protter supports numerous proteomic file formats and automatically integrates a variety of reference protein annotation sources, which can be readily extended via modular plug-ins. A built-in export function produces publication-quality customized protein illustrations, also for large datasets.

The practice of data sharing in the proteomics field took off and quickly spread in recent years as a result of collective effort. Nowadays, most journal editors mandate the submission of the original raw mass spectra to one of the databases of the ProteomeXchange consortium. With the exception of large institutional initiatives such as PeptideAtlas or the GPMDB, few new studies are however based on the reanalysis of mass spectrometry data. A wealth of information is thus left unexploited in public databases and repositories. Here, we present the large-scale reanalysis of 41 publicly available data sets corresponding to experiments carried out on the HeLa cancer cell line using a custom workflow. In addition to the search of new post-translational modification sites and \"missing proteins\", our main goal is to identify single amino acid variants and evaluate their impact on protein expression and stability through the spectral counting quantification approach. The X!Tandem software was selected to perform the search of a total of 56363701 tandem mass spectra against a customized variant protein database, compiled by the application of the in-house MzVar tool on HeLa-specific somatic and genomic variants retrieved from the COSMIC cell line project. After filtering the resulting identifications with a 1% FDR threshold computed at the protein level, 49466 unique peptides were identified in 7266 protein entries, allowing the validation of 5576 protein entries in accordance with the HPP guidelines version 2.1. A new \"missing protein\" was observed (FRAT2, NX-O75474, chromosome 10), and 189 new phosphorylation and 392 new protein N-terminal acetylation sites could be identified.

For three of the nine heterozygous cases where both the variant peptide and its wild-type counterpart were detected, the application of a two-tailed sign test showed a significant difference in the abundance of the two peptide versions.","title":"Large-Scale Reanalysis of Publicly Available HeLa Cell Proteomics Data in the Context of the Human Proteome Project","authors":[{"name":"Robin T."},{"name":"Bairoch A."},{"name":"Muller M."},{"name":"Lisacek F."},{"name":"Lane L."}]},"pmid":"30175587","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence set","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0850"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Nucleic acid features","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1276"},"format":[{"term":"VCF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3016"}]},{"data":{"term":"Sequence set (nucleic acid)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1234"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"},{"term":"Genetic variation analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"},{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"},{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6548-709X","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Thibault Robin","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"Thibault.robin@unige.ch","typeRole":["Developer","Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.sib.swiss/","email":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"trobin","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mzvar","biotoolsID":"mzvar","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-08T14:36:24Z","name":"MzVar","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"}],"additionDate":"2018-09-11T13:06:29Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/sib-pig/mzvar-public/src/master/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Functional annotation of genomic and proteomic data.","language":["Perl","Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":8,"date":"2015-12-21T00:00:00Z","journal":"BMC Genomics","abstract":"© 2015 Weichenberger et al.Background: During the last decade, a great number of extremely valuable large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets have become available to the research community. In addition, dropping costs for conducting high-throughput sequencing experiments and the option to outsource them considerably contribute to an increasing number of researchers becoming active in this field. Even though various computational approaches have been developed to analyze these data, it is still a laborious task involving prudent integration of many heterogeneous and frequently updated data sources, creating a barrier for interested scientists to accomplish their own analysis. Results: We have implemented Dintor, a data integration framework that provides a set of over 30 tools to assist researchers in the exploration of genomics and proteomics datasets. Each of the tools solves a particular task and several tools can be combined into data processing pipelines. Dintor covers a wide range of frequently required functionalities, from gene identifier conversions and orthology mappings to functional annotation of proteins and genetic variants up to candidate gene prioritization and Gene Ontology-based gene set enrichment analysis. Since the tools operate on constantly changing datasets, we provide a mechanism to unambiguously link tools with different versions of archived datasets, which guarantees reproducible results for future tool invocations. We demonstrate a selection of Dintor's capabilities by analyzing datasets from four representative publications. The open source software can be downloaded and installed on a local Unix machine. For reasons of data privacy it can be configured to retrieve local data only. In addition, the Dintor tools are available on our public Galaxy web service at http://dintor.eurac.edu. Conclusions: Dintor is a computational annotation framework for the analysis of genomic and proteomic datasets, providing a rich set of tools that cover the most frequently encountered tasks. A major advantage is its capability to consistently handle multiple versions of tool-associated datasets, supporting the researcher in delivering reproducible results.","title":"Dintor: Functional annotation of genomic and proteomic data","authors":[{"name":"Weichenberger C.X."},{"name":"Blankenburg H."},{"name":"Palermo A."},{"name":"D'Elia Y."},{"name":"Konig E."},{"name":"Bernstein E."},{"name":"Domingues F.S."}]},"pmid":"26691694","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC4687148","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12864-015-2279-5"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Genome annotation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0362"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Christian Weichenberger","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"christian.weichenberger@eurac.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools","cweich"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://dintor.eurac.edu/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Web application"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dintor","biotoolsID":"dintor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-04T10:37:23Z","name":"Dintor","topic":[{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Data submission, annotation and curation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0219"}],"additionDate":"2018-05-23T14:45:49Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://dintor.eurac.edu/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://expasy.org"}],"description":"A database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions.

However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.","title":"STRING v10: Protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of

Here we describe the use of binomial distribution fitting with asymmetric linear squares regression for calculating the accurate deuterium content for mass envelopes of low signal or that contain significant overlap. The approach is demonstrated with a test data set of HIV Env gp140 wherein inclusion of the new analysis regime resulted in obtaining exchange data for 42 additional peptides, improving the sequence coverage by 11 %.

The improved processing algorithms also provide an efficient method for deconvolution of bimodal mass envelopes and EX1 kinetic signatures.

Crux also implements two recently described postprocessing methods: a p value calculation based upon fitting a Weibull distribution to the observed scores, and a semisupervised method that learns to discriminate between target and decoy matches.

It is open source and freely available for academic and commercial use. The Skyline user interface simplifies the development of mass spectrometer methods and the analysis of data from targeted proteomics experiments performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Skyline supports using and creating MS/MS spectral libraries from a wide variety of sources to choose SRM filters and verify results based on previously observed ion trap data. Skyline exports transition lists to and imports the native output files from Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Waters triple quadrupole instruments, seamlessly connecting mass spectrometer output back to the experimental design document. The fast and compact Skyline file format is easily shared, even for experiments requiring many sample injections. A rich array of graphs displays results and provides powerful tools for inspecting data integrity as data are acquired, helping instrument operators to identify problems early. The Skyline dynamic report designer exports tabular data from the Skyline document model for in-depth analysis with common statistical tools.

In this context, the technology has been increasingly used for differential profiling, i.e. broad screening of biomolecular components across multiple samples in order to elucidate the observed phenotypes and discover biomarkers. One of the major challenges in this domain remains development of better solutions for processing of LC/MS data. Results: We present a software package MZmine that enables differential LC/MS analysis of metabolomics data. This software is a toolbox containing methods for all data processing stages preceding differential analysis: spectral filtering, peak detection, alignment and normalization. Specifically, we developed and implemented a new recursive peak search algorithm and a secondary peak picking method for improving already aligned results, as well as a normalization tool that uses multiple internal standards. Visualization tools enable comparative viewing of data across multiple samples. Peak lists can be exported into other data analysis programs. The toolbox has already been utilized in a wide range of applications. We demonstrate its utility on an example of metabolic profiling of Catharanthus roseus cell cultures.

However, there are still limitations especially in high-sample-throughput quantification methods, and most of these relate to extensive computational calculations. The mass accuracy precursor alignment (MAPA) strategy has been shown to be a robust method for relative protein quantification. Its major advantages are high resolution, sensitivity and sample throughput. Its accuracy is data dependent and thus best suited for precursor mass-to-charge precision of ∼1 p.p.m. This protocol describes how to use a software tool (ProtMAX) that allows for the automated alignment of precursors from up to several hundred MS runs within minutes without computational restrictions.

In this work, we introduce Omics Integrator, a software package that takes a variety of \u2018omic\u2019 data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence, interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks connect changes observed in gene expression, protein abundance or other global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases. Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only positive data, but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased toward highly-studied hub proteins, except when they are strongly implicated by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools, Garnet and Forest, that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best connect the observed changes in various datasets.

Suitable genome-wide categories are membership of proteins in biochemical pathways, their annotation with gene ontology terms, sub-cellular localization, presence of protein domains or membership in protein complexes. 2D annotation enrichment detects annotation terms whose members show consistent behavior in one or both of the data dimensions. This consistent behavior can be a correlation between the two data types, such as simultaneous up- or down-regulation in both data dimensions, or a lack thereof, such as regulation in one dimension but no change in the other. For the statistical formulation of the test we introduce a two-dimensional generalization of the nonparametric two-sample test. The false discovery rate is stringently controlled by correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. We also describe one-dimensional annotation enrichment, which can be applied to single omics data.

Representative sequences are derived from each cluster and joined, resulting in a non-redundant reference set representing the maximal available amino acid sequence information for each protein.

Antiangiogenic peptides are therefore promising candidates in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we have collected anti-angiogenic peptides from the literature and analyzed the residue preference in these peptides. Residues like Cys, Pro, Ser, Arg, Trp, Thr and Gly are preferred while Ala, Asp, Ile, Leu, Val and Phe are not preferred in these peptides. There is a positional preference of Ser, Pro, Trp and Cys in the N terminal region and Cys, Gly and Arg in the C terminal region of anti-angiogenic peptides. Motif analysis suggests the motifs \"CG-G\", \"TC\", \"SC\", \"SP-S\", etc., which are highly prominent in anti-angiogenic peptides. Based on the primary analysis, we developed prediction models using different machine learning based methods. The maximum accuracy and MCC for amino acid composition based model is 80.9%and 0.62 respectively. The performance of the models on independent dataset is also reasonable.

After a first attempt in the seventies and early eighties to develop 2-DE analysis software systems on hardware that had poor or even no graphical capabilities, followed in the late eighties by a wave of innovative software developments that were possible thanks to new graphical interface standards such as XWindows, a third generation of 2-DE analysis software packages has now come to maturity.

In combination with aging search programs that are slow and have low sensitivity, or new search programs that are described but not released, these efforts do little to advance the field of cross-linking.Here we present a method pipeline for chemical cross-linking, using two standard cross-linkers, BS3 and BS2G, combined with our freely available CrossWork search program.

Here, we describe TagGraph, a computational tool that overcomes both challenges with an unrestricted string-based search method that is as much as 350-fold faster than existing approaches, and a probabilistic validation model that we optimized for PTM assignments. We applied TagGraph to a published human proteomic dataset of 25 million mass spectra and tripled confident spectrum identifications compared to its original analysis. We identified thousands of modification types on almost 1 million sites in the proteome. We show alternative contexts for highly abundant yet understudied PTMs such as proline hydroxylation, and its unexpected association with cancer mutations.

X!TandemPipeline is a software designed to perform protein inference and to manage redundancy in the results of phosphosite identification by database search. It provides the minimal list of proteins or phosphosites that are present in a set of samples using grouping algorithms based on the principle of parsimony. Regarding proteins, a two-level classification is performed, where groups gather proteins sharing at least one peptide and subgroups gather proteins that are not distinguishable according to the identified peptides. Regarding phosphosites, an innovative approach based on the concept of phosphoisland is used to gather overlapping phosphopeptides. The graphical interface of X!TandemPipeline allows the users to launch X!tandem identification, to inspect spectra and to manually validate their assignment to peptides, to launch the grouping program, and to visualize elementary data as well as grouping and redundancy information. Identification results obtained from other search engines can also be processed. X!TandemPipeline results can be exported as ready-to-use tabulated files or as XML files that can be directly used by the PROTICdb database or by the MassChroQ quantification software.

We have developed an integrative approach to identify and characterize such sites through the analysis of proteolytic products derived from proteins chemically cross-linked by isotopically coded cross-linkers using LC-MALDI tandem mass spectrometry and computer software. This method is specifically tailored toward the rapid analysis of low microgram amounts of proteins or multimeric protein complexes cross-linked with nonlabeled and deuterium-labeled bis-NHS ester cross-linking reagents (both commercially available and readily synthesized). Through labeling with [18O]water solvent and LC-MALDI analysis, the method further allows the possible distinction between Type O and Type 1 or Type 2 modified peptides (monolinks and looplinks or cross-links), although such a distinction is more readily made from analysis of tandem mass spectrometry data. When applied to the bacterial Colicin E7 DNAse/lm7 heterodimeric protein complex, 23 cross-links were identified including six intersubunit cross-links, all between residues that are close in space when examined in the context of the X-ray structure of the heterodimer. In addition, cross-links were successfully identified in five single subunit proteins, beta-lactoglobulin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, myoglobin, and ribonuclease A, establishing the generality of the approach. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","title":"Protein cross-linking analysis using mass spectrometry, isotope-coded cross-linkers, and integrated computational data processing","authors":[{"name":"Seebacher J."},{"name":"Mallick P."},{"name":"Zhang N."},{"name":"Eddes J.S."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Gelb M.H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/pr060154z"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"},{"term":"Protein structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/software/xlink/XLINK_Software_Tools/XLINK_Software_Manual_0.93.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:xlink","biotoolsID":"xlink","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:42:55Z","name":"XLink","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:44Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/XLink.php"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/xglycscan-20140527-quantification-of-glycosite-associated-spectra-counts.html"}],"description":"Open-source software for N-linked glycosite assignment, quantification and quality assessment of data from mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomic analysis.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":"25346946","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://bitbucket.org/paiyetan","email":"paiyeta1@jhu.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://bitbucket.org/paiyetan/xglycscan/overview"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:xglycscan","biotoolsID":"xglycscan","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:42:44Z","name":"XGlycScan","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0081"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T19:04:36Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/paiyetan/xglycscan/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Interogate protein-protein interactions and protein structure using cross-links FASTA databases.","language":["Perl"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":55,"date":"2010-05-07T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"We developed an informatic method to identify tandem mass spectra composed of chemically cross-linked peptides from those of linear peptides and to assign sequence to each of the two unique peptide sequences.

The improved spectral quality enables more accurate de novo sequencing for identification of post-translational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms.Results: In this study, a new de novo sequencing algorithm, called Vonode, has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. To fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra, a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions. Consensus sequence tags were inferred for 11,422 spectra with an average peptide length of 5.5 residues from a total of 40,297 input spectra acquired in a 24-hour proteomics measurement of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The accuracy of inferred consensus sequence tags was 84%. According to our comparison, the performance of Vonode was shown to be superior to the PepNovo v2.0 algorithm, in terms of the number of de novo sequenced spectra and the sequencing accuracy.Conclusions: Here, we improved de novo sequencing performance by developing a new algorithm specifically for high-resolution tandem mass spectral data.

Next-generation sequencing transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), global microarrays, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based proteomics have demonstrated immense value to genome curators as individual sources of information, however, integrating these data types to validate and improve structural annotation remains a major challenge. Current visual and statistical analytic tools are focused on a single data type, or existing software tools are retrofitted to analyze new data forms. We present Visual Exploration and Statistics to Promote Annotation (VESPA) is a new interactive visual analysis software tool focused on assisting scientists with the annotation of prokaryotic genomes though the integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data with current genome location coordinates.Results: VESPA is a desktop Java™ application that integrates high-throughput proteomics data (peptide-centric) and transcriptomics (probe or RNA-Seq) data into a genomic context, all of which can be visualized at three levels of genomic resolution. Data is interrogated via searches linked to the genome visualizations to find regions with high likelihood of mis-annotation. Search results are linked to exports for further validation outside of VESPA or potential coding-regions can be analyzed concurrently with the software through interaction with BLAST. VESPA is demonstrated on two use cases (Yersinia pestis Pestoides F and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002) to demonstrate the rapid manner in which mis-annotations can be found and explored in VESPA using either proteomics data alone, or in combination with transcriptomic data.Conclusions: VESPA is an interactive visual analytics tool that integrates high-throughput data into a genomic context to facilitate the discovery of structural mis-annotations in prokaryotic genomes. Data is evaluated via visual analysis across multiple levels of genomic resolution, linked searches and interaction with existing bioinformatics tools. We highlight the novel functionality of VESPA and core programming requirements for visualization of these large heterogeneous datasets for a client-side application.

Modification-specific mass increments, neutral losses or diagnostic fragment ions in peptide mass spectra provide direct evidence for the presence of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation or glycosylation. However, the commonly used database search engines are not always practical for exhaustive searches for multiple modifications and concomitant missed proteolytic cleavage sites in large-scale proteomic datasets, since the search space is dramatically expanded. We present a formal definition of the problem of searching databases with tandem mass spectra of peptides that are partially (sub-stoichiometrically) modified. In addition, an improved search algorithm and peptide scoring scheme that includes modification specific ion information from MS/MS spectra was implemented and tested using the Virtual Expert Mass Spectrometrist (VEMS) software. A set of 2825 peptide MS/MS spectra were searched with 16 variable modifications and 6 missed cleavages. The scoring scheme returned a large set of post-translationally modified peptides including precise information on modification type and position. The scoring scheme was able to extract and distinguish the near-isobaric modifications of trimethylation and acetylation of lysine residues based on the presence and absence of diagnostic neutral losses and immonium ions. In addition, the VEMS software contains a range of new features for analysis of mass spectrometry data obtained in large-scale proteomic experiments. © 2005 American Chemical Society.","title":"VEMS 3.0: Algorithms and computational tools for tandem mass spectrometry based identification of post-translational modifications in proteins","authors":[{"name":"Matthiesen R."},{"name":"Trelle M.B."},{"name":"Hojrup P."},{"name":"Bunkenborg J."},{"name":"Jensen O.N."}]},"pmid":"16335983","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Blind peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3647"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vems","biotoolsID":"vems","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:42:12Z","name":"VEMS","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:25Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://portugene.com/vems.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Automate the high throughput in silico vaccine candidate prediction process for the identification of putative vaccine candidates against the proteome of bacterial pathogens.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":16,"date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00Z","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: With advances in reverse vaccinology approaches, a progressive improvement has been observed in the prediction of putative vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology has changed the way of discovery and provides a mean to propose target identification in reduced time and labour. In this regard, high throughput genomic sequencing technologies and supporting bioinformatics tools have greatly facilitated the prompt analysis of pathogens, where various predicted candidates have been found effective against certain infections and diseases. A pipeline, VacSol, is designed here based on a similar approach to predict putative vaccine candidates both rapidly and efficiently. Results: VacSol, a new pipeline introduced here, is a highly scalable, multi-mode, and configurable software designed to automate the high throughput in silico vaccine candidate prediction process for the identification of putative vaccine candidates against the proteome of bacterial pathogens. Vaccine candidates are screened using integrated, well-known and robust algorithms/tools for proteome analysis, and the results from the VacSol software are presented in five different formats by taking proteome sequence as input in FASTA file format. The utility of VacSol is tested and compared with published data and using the Helicobacter pylori 26695 reference strain as a benchmark. Conclusion: VacSol rapidly and efficiently screens the whole bacterial pathogen proteome to identify a few predicted putative vaccine candidate proteins. This pipeline has the potential to save computational costs and time by efficiently reducing false positive candidate hits.

Its underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProtKB records. Taxon-specificity of the tryptic peptide is successively derived from these occurrences using a novel lowest common ancestor approach that is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies.

Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovo+, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides). Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested onWindows, Ubuntu and OS X machines. UniNovo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd.edu/Software/UniNovo.html along with the manual.

Next-generation mass spectrometric (MS) techniques such as SWATH-MS have substantially increased the throughput and reproducibility of proteomic analysis, but ensuring consistent quantification of thousands of peptide analytes across multiple liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) runs remains a challenging and laborious manual process. To produce highly consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data matrices in an automated fashion, we developed TRIC (http://proteomics.ethz.ch/tric/), a software tool that utilizes fragment-ion data to perform cross-run alignment, consistent peak-picking and quantification for high-throughput targeted proteomics. TRIC reduced the identification error compared to a state-of-the-art SWATH-MS analysis without alignment by more than threefold at constant recall while correcting for highly nonlinear chromatographic effects. On a pulsed-SILAC experiment performed on human induced pluripotent stem cells, TRIC was able to automatically align and quantify thousands of light and heavy isotopic peak groups. Thus, TRIC fills a gap in the pipeline for automated analysis of massively parallel targeted proteomics data sets.","title":"TRIC: An automated alignment strategy for reproducible protein quantification in targeted proteomics","authors":[{"name":"Rost H.L."},{"name":"Liu Y."},{"name":"D'Agostino G."},{"name":"Zanella M."},{"name":"Navarro P."},{"name":"Rosenberger G."},{"name":"Collins B.C."},{"name":"Gillet L."},{"name":"Testa G."},{"name":"Malmstrom L."},{"name":"Aebersold R."}]},"pmid":"27479329","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Sequence alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/aebersold.html","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://github.com/msproteomicstools","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://proteomics.ethz.ch/msproteomicstools/"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://github.com/msproteomicstools/msproteomicstools/blob/master/TRIC-README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tric","biotoolsID":"tric","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:41:37Z","name":"TRIC","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T19:02:56Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://proteomics.ethz.ch/tric/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Analyze thermal proteome profiling (TPP) experiments with varying temperatures (TR) or compound concentrations (CCR).","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dorothee Childs","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Nils Kurzawa","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dorothee Childs","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"dorothee.childs@embl.de","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"hdhub","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TPP/inst/doc/TPP_introduction_1D.pdf"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TPP/inst/doc/TPP_introduction_2D.pdf"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TPP/inst/doc/NPARC_analysis_of_TPP_TR_data.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["3.4.2"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tpp","biotoolsID":"tpp","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:41:27Z","name":"TPP","topic":[{"term":"Drug discovery","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3336"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-06-23T07:16:50Z","collectionID":["de.NBI","Proteomics","Bioconductor"],"homepage":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/TPP/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Online Protein Processing Resource","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":11,"date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"We here present The Online Protein Processing Resource (TOPPR; http://iomics.ugent.be/toppr/), an online database that contains thousands of published proteolytically processed sites in human and mouse proteins.

Background: In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the statistical significance of a peptide-spectrum or proteinspectrum match is an important indicator of the correctness of the peptide or protein identification. In bottom-up mass spectrometry, probabilistic models, such as the generating function method, have been successfully applied to compute the statistical significance of peptide-spectrum matches for short peptides containing no posttranslational modifications. As top-down mass spectrometry, which often identifies intact proteins with posttranslational modifications, becomes available in many laboratories, the estimation of statistical significance of topdown protein identification results has come into great demand. Results: In this paper, we study an extended generating function method for accurately computing the statistical significance of protein-spectrum matches with post-translational modifications. Experiments show that the extended generating function method achieves high accuracy in computing spectral probabilities and false discovery rates. Conclusions: The extended generating function method is a non-trivial extension of the generating function method for bottom-up mass spectrometry. It can be used to choose the correct protein-spectrum match from several candidate protein-spectrum matches for a spectrum, as well as separate correct protein-spectrum matches from incorrect ones identified from a large number of tandem mass spectra.","title":"Spectral probabilities of top-down tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Liu X."},{"name":"Segar M.W."},{"name":"Li S.C."},{"name":"Kim S."}]},"pmid":"24564718","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2886"},"format":[{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"PTM localisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3755"},{"term":"PTM identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3645"},{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"},{"term":"Validation of peptide-spectrum matches","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3648"},{"term":"Filtering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3695"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Xiaowen Liu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"xwliu@iupui.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://proteomics.informatics.iupui.edu/software/toppic/tutorial.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Web application"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:toppic","biotoolsID":"toppic","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:41:17Z","name":"TopPIC","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:25Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://proteomics.informatics.iupui.edu/software/toppic/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Computational tools for the alignment and superposition of protein structures are essential instruments in structural biology.

Emphasis is placed on the detailed description and classification of evidence supporting the reported identification of each cleavage site, terminus and modification. A suite of filters can be applied to select supporting evidence. A dynamic network representation of the relationship between proteases, their substrates and inhibitors as well as visualization of protease cleavage site specificities complements the information displayed.

In 2014, we developed TCGA-Assembler, a software pipeline for retrieval and processing of public TCGA data. In 2016, TCGA data were transferred from the TCGA data portal to the Genomic Data Commons (GDCs), which is supported by a different set of data storage and retrieval mechanisms. In addition, new proteomics data of TCGA samples have been generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program, which were not available for downloading through TCGA-Assembler. It is desirable to acquire and integrate data from both GDC and CPTAC. Results We develop TCGA-assembler 2 (TA2) to automatically download and integrate data from GDC and CPTAC. We make substantial improvement on the functionality of TA2 to enhance user experience and software performance. TA2 together with its previous version have helped more than 2000 researchers from 64 countries to access and utilize TCGA and CPTAC data in their research. Availability of TA2 will continue to allow existing and new users to conduct reproducible research based on TCGA and CPTAC data.

KGaA, Weinheim.Democratization of genomics technologies has enabled the rapid determination of genotypes. More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.","title":"Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible proteomics informatics","authors":[{"name":"Deutsch E.W."},{"name":"Mendoza L."},{"name":"Shteynberg D."},{"name":"Slagel J."},{"name":"Sun Z."},{"name":"Moritz R.L."}]},"pmid":"25631240","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC4506239","version":null,"doi":"10.1002/prca.201400164"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"X!Tandem XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3711"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Sequence coordinate conversion","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3267"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=TPP:Authors_and_Contributors","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:Tandem2XML"}],"community":null,"version":["5.0.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tandem2xml","biotoolsID":"tandem2xml","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:40:44Z","name":"Tandem2XML","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-11-30T18:57:28Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:Tandem2XML"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Converts ABI SCIEX 4700/4800 t2d files to mzXML.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://sequest.scripps.edu/ygao/download/converter.html"}],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:t2d_converter","biotoolsID":"t2d_converter","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:40:43Z","name":"T2D converter","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:55Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.pepchem.org"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://lgatto.github.com/synapter/"}],"description":"This package provides functionality to reanalyse label-free proteomics data acquired on a Synapt G2 mass spectrometer.

Ion mobility separation allows an additional dimension of precursor separation inside the instrument, without incurring an increase in instrument time. We comprehensively investigated the effects of TWIMS on data-independent acquisition on a Synapt G2 instrument. We observed that if fragmentation is performed post TWIMS, more accurate assignment of fragment ions to precursors is possible in data independent acquisition. This allows up to 60% higher proteome coverage and higher confidence of protein and peptide identifications. Moreover, the majority of peptides and proteins identified upon application of TWIMS span the lower intensity range of the proteome. It has also been demonstrated in several studies that employing IMS results in higher peak capacity of separation and consequently more accurate and precise quantitation of lower intensity precursor ions. We observe that employing TWIMS results in an attenuation of the detected ion current. We postulate that this effect is binary; sensitivity is reduced due to ion scattering during transfer into a high pressure \"IMS zone\", sensitivity is reduced due to the saturation of detector digitizer as a result of the IMS concentration effect. This latter effect limits the useful linear range of quantitation, compromising quantitation accuracy of high intensity peptides. We demonstrate that the signal loss from detector saturation and transmission loss can be deconvoluted by investigation of the peptide isotopic envelope. We discuss the origin and extent of signal loss and suggest methods to minimize these effects on q-TWIMS-TOF instrument in the light of different experimental designs and other IMS/MS platforms described previously. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","title":"Effects of traveling wave ion mobility separation on data independent acquisition in proteomics studies","authors":[{"name":"Shliaha P.V."},{"name":"Bond N.J."},{"name":"Gatto L."},{"name":"Lilley K.S."}]},"pmid":"23514362","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/pr300775k"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1520-2268","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Laurent Gatto","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"lg390@cam.ac.uk","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Sebastian Gibb","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"mail@sebastiangibb.de","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/synapter.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.16.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:synapter","biotoolsID":"synapter","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:40:40Z","name":"synapter","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:04:23Z","collectionID":["Proteomics","BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/synapter.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Protein ligand docking server, accessible via the ExPASy web server, and based on EADock DSS.

An efficient Ajax/HTML interface was designed and implemented so that scientists can easily submit dockings and retrieve the predicted complexes. For automated docking tasks, a programmatic SOAP interface has been set up and template programs can be downloaded in Perl, Python and PHP. The web site also provides an access to a database of manually curated complexes, based on the Ligand Protein Database.

Principal component and fuzzy duster analyses of the proteome database of 935 protein spot profiles revealed principal kinetic patterns. Online linkage of the proteome database (SWICZ) to a protein-function database (KEGG) revealed limited correlations between expression profiles and metabolic pathway activities. Proteins belonging to principal metabolic pathways defined characteristic kinetic profiles correlated with the physiological state of the culture. These analyses supported the concept that metabolic flux was regulated not by individual enzymes but rather by groups of enzymes whose synthesis responded to changes in nutritional conditions. Higher-level regulation is reflected by the distribution of all kinetic profiles into only nine groups. The observation that enzymes representing principal metabolic pathways displayed their own distinctive average kinetic profiles suggested that expression of a \"high-flux backbone\" may dominate regulation of metabolic flux. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The use of data-independent acquisition methods such as SWATH for mass spectrometry based proteomics is usually performed with peptide MS/MS assay libraries which enable identification and quantitation of peptide peak areas. Reference assay libraries can be generated locally through information dependent acquisition, or obtained from community data repositories for commonly studied organisms. However, there have been no studies performed to systematically evaluate how locally generated or repository-based assay libraries affect SWATH performance for proteomic studies. To undertake this analysis, we developed a software workflow, SwathXtend, which generates extended peptide assay libraries by integration with a local seed library and delivers statistical analysis of SWATH-quantitative comparisons. We designed test samples using peptides from a yeast extract spiked into peptides from human K562 cell lysates at three different ratios to simulate protein abundance change comparisons. SWATH-MS performance was assessed using local and external assay libraries of varying complexities and proteome compositions. These experiments demonstrated that local seed libraries integrated with external assay libraries achieve better performance than local assay libraries alone, in terms of the number of identified peptides and proteins and the specificity to detect differentially abundant proteins. Our findings show that the performance of extended assay libraries is influenced by the MS/MS feature similarity of the seed and external libraries, while statistical analysis using multiple testing corrections increases the statistical rigor needed when searching against large extended assay libraries.","title":"SWATH mass spectrometry performance using extended peptide MS/MS assay libraries","authors":[{"name":"Wu J.X."},{"name":"Song X."},{"name":"Pascovici D."},{"name":"Zaw T."},{"name":"Care N."},{"name":"Krisp C."},{"name":"Molloy M.P."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1074/mcp.M115.055558"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jemma Wu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jwu@proteome.org.au","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SwathXtend.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:swathxtend","biotoolsID":"swathxtend","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:40:21Z","name":"SwathXtend","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:57:09Z","collectionID":["Proteomics","BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SwathXtend.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Support Vector Machine Transmembrane (SVMtm) predicts transmembrane helices when given protein sequences in FASTA format.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":71,"date":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","abstract":"A new method has been developed for prediction of transmembrane helices using support vector machines.

This approach can be applied to any shotgun proteomics data set acquired with high mass accuracy for quantification at the MS<sup>1<\/sup> level. The SuperQuant approach was developed and implemented as a processing node within the Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.x. The performance of the developed approach was tested using dimethyl-labeled HeLa lysate samples having a ratio between channels of 10(heavy):4(medium):1(light). Peptides were fragmented with collision-induced dissociation using isolation windows of 1, 2, and 4 Th while recording data both with high-resolution and low-resolution. The results obtained using SuperQuant were compared to those using the conventional ion trap-based approach (low mass accuracy MS<sup>2<\/sup> spectra), which is known to achieve high identification performance. Compared to the common high-resolution approach, the SuperQuant approach identifies up to 70% more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), 40% more peptides, and 20% more proteins at the 0.01 FDR level. It identifies more PSMs and peptides than the ion trap-based approach. Improvements in identifications resulted in up to 10% more PSMs, 15% more peptides, and 10% more proteins quantified on the same raw data. The developed approach does not affect the accuracy of the quantification and observed coefficients of variation between replicates of the same proteins were close to the values typical for other precursor ion-based quantification methods.

The underlying algorithms comprise multiple manual steps, whereas the few existing implementations typically restrict the user to a very limited set of molecular descriptors. Results: We present Structuprint, a free standalone software that fully automates the rendering of protein surface maps, given - at the very least - a directory with a PDB file and an amino acid property. The tool comes with a default database of 328 descriptors, which can be extended or substituted by user-provided ones. The core algorithm comprises the generation of a mould of the protein surface, which is subsequently converted to a sphere and mapped to two dimensions, using the Miller cylindrical projection. Structuprint is partly optimized for multicore computers, making the rendering of animations of entire molecular dynamics simulations feasible. Conclusions: Structuprint is an efficient application, implementing a molecular cartography algorithm for protein surfaces. According to the results of a benchmark, its memory requirements and execution time are reasonable, allowing it to run even on low-end personal computers.

Previously, we have established a framework for integrating transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data by searching for the solution to the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. Here, we present a web server, SteinerNet, to make this method available in a user-friendly format for a broad range of users with data from any species. At a minimum, a user only needs to provide a set of experimentally detected proteins and/or genes and the server will search for connections among these data from the provided interactomes for yeast, human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. More advanced users can upload their own interactome data as well.

The model relies on summation of the retention coefficients of the individual amino acids, as in previous approaches, but additional terms are introduced that depend on the retention coefficients for amino acids at the N-terminal of the peptide. In the 17-protein mixture, optimization of two sets of coefficients, along with additional compensation for peptide length and hydrophobicity, yielded a linear dependence of retention time on hydrophobicity, with an R2 value about 0.94. The predictive capability of the model was used to distinguish peptides with close m/z values and for detailed peptide mapping of selected proteins. Its applicability was tested on columns of different sizes, from nano- to narrow-bore, and for direct sample injection, or injection via a pre-column.

Consequently, lists of potential interactions must be pruned of contaminants before network construction and interpretation, historically an expensive, time-intensive, and error-prone task. In recent years, numerous computational methods were developed to identify genuine interactions from the hundreds of candidates. Here, comparative analysis of three popular algorithms, HGSCore, CompPASS, and SAINT, revealed complementarity in their classification accuracies, which is supported by their divergent scoring strategies. We improved each algorithm by an average area under a receiver operating characteristics curve increase of 16% by integrating a variety of indirect data known to correlate with established protein-protein interactions, including mRNA coexpression, gene ontologies, domain-domain binding affinities, and homologous protein interactions. Each APMS scoring approach was incorporated into a separate logistic regression model along with the indirect features; the resulting three classifiers demonstrate improved performance on five diverse APMS data sets. To facilitate APMS data scoring within the scientific community, we created Spotlite, a user-friendly and fast web application. Within Spotlite, data can be scored with the augmented classifiers, annotated, and visualized (http://cancer.unc.edu/majorlab/software.php).

Our paper addresses this by construction of a compact database that contains all useful information expressed in RNA-seq reads.

Background: Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis is the only cyanobacterium that in addition to being studied at the molecular level and subjected to gene manipulation, can also be mass cultivated in outdoor ponds for commercial use as a food supplement. Thus, encountering environmental changes, including temperature stresses, is common during the mass production of Spirulina. The use of cyanobacteria as an experimental platform, especially for photosynthetic gene manipulation in plants and bacteria, is becoming increasingly important. Understanding the mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks that underlie low- and high-temperature responses is relevant to Spirulina mass production. To accomplish this goal, high-throughput techniques such as OMICs analyses are used. Thus, large datasets must be collected, managed and subjected to information extraction. Therefore, databases including (i) proteomic analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and (ii) domain/motif visualization tools are required for potential use in temperature response models for plant chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria. Descriptions: A web-based repository was developed including an embedded database, SpirPro, and tools for network visualization. Proteome data were analyzed integrated with protein-protein interactions and/or metabolic pathways from KEGG. The repository provides various information, ranging from raw data (2D-gel images) to associated results, such as data from interaction and/or pathway analyses. This integration allows in silico analyses of protein-protein interactions affected at the metabolic level and, particularly, analyses of interactions between and within the affected metabolic pathways under temperature stresses for comparative proteomic analysis. The developed tool, which is coded in HTML with CSS/JavaScript and depicted in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is designed for interactive analysis and exploration of the constructed network. SpirPro is publicly available on the web at http://spirpro.sbi.kmutt.ac.th . Conclusions: SpirPro is an analysis platform containing an integrated proteome and PPI database that provides the most comprehensive data on this cyanobacterium at the systematic level. As an integrated database, SpirPro can be applied in various analyses, such as temperature stress response networking analysis in cyanobacterial models and interacting domain-domain analysis between proteins of interest.","title":"SpirPro: A Spirulina proteome database and web-based tools for the analysis of protein-protein interactions at the metabolic level in Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis C1","authors":[{"name":"Senachak J."},{"name":"Cheevadhanarak S."},{"name":"Hongsthong A."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-015-0676-z"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Pathway or network","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2600"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"},{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}],"note":"Inter-pathway KEGG Pathway Protein-protein interactions between pathways","input":[{"data":{"term":"Pathway ID (KEGG)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2343"},"format":[]},{"data":{"term":"Name","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2099"},"format":[]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"},{"term":"Pathway or network visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"King Mongkut's University of Technology (Thonburi)","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"KMUTT","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":null,"name":"Jittisak Senachak","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jittisak.sen@biotec.or.th","typeRole":["Support"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jittisak Senachak","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"jittisak.sen@biotec.or.th","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"KMUTT","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://spirpro.sbi.kmutt.ac.th/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application","Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spirpro","biotoolsID":"spirpro","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:39:31Z","name":"SpirPro","topic":[{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2016-02-12T08:12:57Z","collectionID":["KMUTT tools","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://spirpro.sbi.kmutt.ac.th"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"SPEDRE (Systematic Parameter Estimation in Data-Rich Environments) is a web server for estimating rate parameters of cell signalling dynamics in data-rich environments.

If data are available for all species in the network, it provides global coverage of the parameter space, at low resolution and with approximate accuracy.

Shotgun proteomics experiments often take the form of a differential analysis, where two or more samples are compared against each other. The objective is to identify proteins that are either unique to a specific sample or a set of samples (qualitative differential proteomics), or that are significantly differentially expressed in one or more samples (quantitative differential proteomics). However, the success depends on the availability of a reliable protein sequence database for each sample. To perform such an analysis in the absence of a database, we here propose a novel, generic pipeline comprising an adapted spectral similarity score derived from database search algorithms that compares samples at the spectrum level to detect unique spectra. We applied our pipeline to compare two parasitic tapeworms: Taenia solium and Taenia hydatigena, of which only the former poses a threat to humans. Furthermore, because the genome of T. solium recently became available, we were able to prove the effectiveness and reliability of our pipeline a posteriori.","title":"A pipeline for differential proteomics in unsequenced species","authors":[{"name":"Yllmaz S."},{"name":"Victor B."},{"name":"Hulstaert N."},{"name":"Vandermarliere E."},{"name":"Barsnes H."},{"name":"Degroeve S."},{"name":"Gupta S."},{"name":"Sticker A."},{"name":"Gabriel S."},{"name":"Dorny P."},{"name":"Palmblad M."},{"name":"Martens L."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00140"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"Ghent University","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"ugent.be","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"lennart.martens@ugent.be","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"Katrijn.Vannerum@ugent.be","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/compomics/spectrum_similarity"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://github.com/compomics/spectrum_similarity/wiki"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spectrum_similarity","biotoolsID":"spectrum_similarity","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:39:25Z","name":"Spectrum similarity","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2016-09-01T08:57:52Z","collectionID":["BIG N2N","Proteomics","VIB","Compomics","UGent"],"homepage":"https://github.com/compomics/spectrum_similarity"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/spectrogene-genome-annotation-using-top-down-mass-spectrometry.html"}],"description":"A tool for top-down protein identification using unannotated bacterial genome.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":6,"date":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"© 2015 American Chemical Society.In the past decade, proteogenomics has emerged as a valuable technique that contributes to the state-of-the-art in genome annotation; however, previous proteogenomic studies were limited to bottom-up mass spectrometry and did not take advantage of top-down approaches.

Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Spectra (SWATH) and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) methods increase reproducibility of acquired data because the classical precursor selection is omitted and all present precursors are fragmented. However, especially for targeted data extraction, MS coordinates (retention time information precursor and fragment masses) are required for the particular entities (peptide ions). These coordinates are usually generated in a so-called discovery experiment earlier on in the project if not available in public spectral library repositories. The quality of the assay panel is crucial to ensure appropriate downstream analysis. For that, a method is needed to create spectral libraries and to export customizable assay panels. Results: Here, we present a versatile set of functions to generate assay panels from spectral libraries for use in targeted data extraction methods (SWATH/DIA) in the area of proteomics.

Traditionally it has been difficult to develop new algorithms to identify these atypical peptides because of the lack of a large set of annotated spectra from which to learn the altered fragmentation pattern.

Technical limitations of current proteomic platforms such as limited reproducibility and low throughput make this a challenging task. A new LC-MS-based platform is able to generate complex peptide patterns from the analysis of proteolyzed protein samples at high throughput and represents a promising approach for quantitative proteomics. A crucial component of the LC-MS approach is the accurate evaluation of the abundance of detected peptides over many samples and the identification of peptide features that can stratify samples with respect to their genetic, physiological, or environmental origins. We present here a new software suite, SpecArray, that generates a peptide versus sample array from a set of LC-MS data. A peptide array stores the relative abundance of thousands of peptide features in many samples and is in a format identical to that of a gene expression microarray. A peptide array can be subjected to an unsupervised clustering analysis to stratify samples or to a discriminant analysis to identify discriminatory peptide features. We applied the SpecArray to analyze two sets of LC-MS data: one was from four repeat LC-MS analyses of the same glycopeptide sample, and another was from LC-MS analysis of serum samples of five male and five female mice.

Chemical cross-linking has emerged as a powerful approach for the structural characterization of proteins and protein complexes. However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked or XL) peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge. Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated through commonly used cross-linkers (e.g., BS3/DSS). Our software introduces a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2D interaction map and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a data set obtained from the human HSP90. The software is freely available for academic use at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl. A video demonstrating the tool is available at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl/video.

PIR-cross-linkers contain labile bonds that are specifically fragmented under low energy collision or photodissociation conditions in the mass spectrometer source, thus releasing cross-linked peptides. Successful analysis of PIR-cross-linked proteins requires the use of expected mathematical relationships between cross-linked complexes and released peptides after fragmentation of the labile PIR bonds. Presented here is a next-generation software tool, BLinks, for use in the analysis and identification of PIR-cross-linked proteins. BLinks is an advancement beyond our previous efforts by incorporation of chromatographic profiles that must match between cross-linked complexes and released peptides to enable estimation of p-values to help filter true relationships from complex data sets. Additionally, BLinks was used to incorporate Mascot database searching results from subsequent MS/MS analysis of the released peptides to facilitate identification of cross-linked proteins. BLinks was used in the analysis of human serum albumin, and 46 interpeptide relationships were found spanning 30 proximal residues with a 2.2% false discovery rate. BLinks was also used to track peptides involved in multiple, coeluting relationships that make accurate identification of protein interactions difficult. An additional 10 interpeptide relationships were identified despite poor correlation using the profiling tools provided with BLinks. Additionally, BLinks can be used to globally map all interpeptide relationships from the data analysis and customize subsequent analysis to target specific peptides of interest, thus making it a useful tool for both discovery of protein interactions and mapping protein topology. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","title":"Improved strategies for rapid identification of chemically cross-linked peptides using protein interaction reporter technology","authors":[{"name":"Hoopmann M.R."},{"name":"Weisbrod C.R."},{"name":"Bruce J.E."}]},"pmid":"20886857","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"SILAC","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3638"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://brucelab.gs.washington.edu/","email":"jimbruce@uw.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://brucelab.gs.washington.edu/SILACtor/instructions.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:silactor","biotoolsID":"silactor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:38:32Z","name":"SILACtor","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:59:37Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://brucelab.gs.washington.edu/software.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Sherenga de novo sequencing","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":423,"date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","abstract":"Peptide sequencing via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the most powerful tools in proteomics for identifying proteins.

We have developed a new algorithm, SHERENGA, for de novo interpretation that automatically learns fragment ion types and intensity thresholds from a collection of test spectra gene-rated from any type of mass spectrometer. The test data are used to construct optimal path scoring in the graph representations of MS/MS spectra. A ranked list of high scoring paths corresponds to potential peptide sequences.

They therefore provide limited information on less studied kinases and fewer unexpected relationships given that better studied signaling events can mask condition- or cell-specific 'network wiring'. SELPHI is a web-based tool providing in-depth analysis of phospho-proteomics data that is intuitive and accessible to non-bioinformatics experts. It uses correlation analysis of phospho-sites to extract kinase/phosphatase and phospho-peptide associations, and highlights the potential flow of signaling in the system under study. We illustrate SELPHI via analysis of phospho-proteomics data acquired in the presence of erlotinib-a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-in cancer cells expressing TKIresistant and -sensitive variants of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. In this data set, SELPHI revealed information overlooked by the reporting study, including the known role of MET and EPHA2 kinases in conferring resistance to erlotinib in TKI sensitive strains.

Computational tools have improved interpretation of these datasets by enabling the identification of biological processes and pathways that are most likely to explain the measured results. These tools are primarily designed to analyse data from a single experiment (e.g. drug treatment versus control), creating a need for computational algorithms that can handle heterogeneous datasets across multiple experimental conditions at once. Summary: We introduce SAMNetWeb, a web-based tool that enables functional enrichment analysis and visualization of high-throughput datasets. SAMNetWeb can analyse two distinct data types (e.g. mRNA expression and global proteomics) simultaneously across multiple experimental systems to identify pathways activated in these experiments and then visualize the pathways in a single interaction network.

Our previous work suggested that in order to accurately calculate (or \"project\") gradient retention times on a wide range of HPLC systems using a single set of isocratic retention data, the precise shape of both the gradient and flow rate profiles produced by each instrument must be properly taken into account. However, accurate measurement of these system properties is difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we describe an approach that uses the measured gradient retention times of a set of standard solutes spiked into the sample along with their known isocratic retention vs. eluent composition relationships to determine the effective gradient and flow rate profiles by back-calculation. Retention \"projections\" of 20 other solutes using these back-calculated profiles, under various chromatographic conditions typical of metabolomics experiments, were remarkably accurate (as good as 0.23% of the gradient time, R2 up to 0.99996), being very near the level of retention reproducibility. Our calculations suggest that this level of accuracy will allow a quadrupole MS to identify 38-fold more compounds out of a simulated mixture of 7307; it would allow an FTICR-MS to improve its identification rate nearly two-fold with the same mixture. Moreover, very little effort is required of the user.

Breaking a structure into relatively rigid parts, the so-called dynamic domains, may help comprehend the complexity of protein's mobility. We propose a new approach called ResiCon (Residue Contacts analysis), which performs this task by applying a data-mining analysis of an ensemble of protein configurations and recognizes dynamic domains, hinges and interfacial regions, by considering contacts between residues. Results: Dynamic domains found by ResiCon are more compact than those identified by two other popular methods: PiSQRD and GeoStaS. The current analysis was carried out using a known reference set of 30 NMR protein structures, as well as molecular dynamics simulation data of flap opening events in HIV-1 protease. The more detailed analysis of HIV-1 protease dataset shows that ResiCon identified dynamic domains involved in structural changes of functional importance.

However, enzymes with high sequence identity may acquire differential functions other than the common catalytic ability. It is probable that each of their variable regions consists of a unique peptide motif (UPM), which selectively interacts with other cellular proteins, rendering additional biological activities. The ability to identify and localize such UPMs is paramount in recognizing the characteristic role of each member of a protein family. Results: We have developed a reinforced merging algorithm (RMA) with which non-gapped UPMs were identified in a variety of query protein sequences including members of human ribonuclease A (RNaseA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Smaand-Mad related protein families (Smad). The UPMs generally occupy specific positions in the resolved 3-D structures, especially the loop regions on the structural surfaces. These motifs coincide with the recognition sites for antibodies, as the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antibodies were shown to overlap with the UPMs. Most of the UPMs were found to correlate well with the potential antigenic regions predicted by PROTEAN. Furthermore, an accuracy of 70% can be achieved in terms of mapping a UPM to an epitope.

With the increasing number of experimental phosphorylation sites that has been identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the desire to explore the networks of protein kinases and substrates is motivated. Manning et al. have identified 518 human kinase genes, which provide a starting point for comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylationnetworks. In this study, a knowledgebase is developed to integrate experimentally verified protein phosphorylation data and protein- protein interaction data for constructing the protein kinase-substrate phosphorylation networks in human. A total of 21 110 experimental verified phosphorylation sites within 5092 human proteins are collected. However, only 4138 phosphorylation sites (̃20%) have the annotation of catalytic kinases from public domain. In order to fully investigate how protein kinases regulate the intracellular processes, a published kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction tool, named KinasePhos is incorporated for assigning the potential kinase. The web-based system, RegPhos, can let users input a group of human proteins; consequently, the phosphorylation network associated with the protein subcellular localization can be explored. Additionally, time-coursed microarray expression data is subsequently used to represent the degree of similarity in the expression profiles of network members. A case study demonstrates that the proposed scheme not only identify the correct network of insulin signaling but also detect a novel signaling pathway that may cross-talk with insulin signaling network.

Therefore, a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or profile derived from a set of peptides known to bind to a specific MHC molecule would be a suitable predictor of whether other peptides might bind, thus anticipating possible T-cell epitopes within a protein. In this approach, the binding potential of any peptide sequence (query) to a given MHC molecule is linked to its similarity to a group of aligned peptides known to bind to that MHC, and can be obtained by comparing the query to the PSSM, This article describes the derivation of alignments and profiles from a collection of peptides known to bind a specific MHC, compatible with the structural and molecular basis of the peptide-MHC class I (MHCI) interaction. Moreover, in order to apply these profiles to the prediction of peptide-MHCI binding, we have developed a new search algorithm (RANKPEP) that ranks all possible peptides from an input protein using the PSSM coefficients. The predictive power of the method was evaluated by running RANKPEP on proteins known to bear MHCI Kb- and Db-restricted T-cell epitopes. Analysis of the results indicates that > 80% of these epitopes are among the top 2% of scoring peptides. Prediction of peptide-MHC binding using a variety of MHCI-specific PSSMs is available on line at our RANK-PEP web server (www.mifoundation.org/Tools/rank- pep.html).

Although the incorporation of 18O in the C-terminal carboxyl group during endoproteinase digestion in the presence of H218O makes the process of labeling facile, the ease and effectiveness of label incorporation have in some regards been outweighed by the difficulties in interpreting the resulting spectra. Complex isotope patterns result from the composition of unlabeled (18O0), singly labeled (18O1), and doubly labeled species (18)2) as well as contributions from the naturally occurring isotopes (e.g. 13C and 15N). Moreover because labeling is enzymatic, the number of 18O atoms incorporated can vary from peptide to peptide. Finally it is difficult to distinguish highly up-regulated from highly down-regulated or C-terminal peptides. We have developed an algorithm entitled regression analysis applied to mass spectrometry (RAAMS) that automatically, rapidly, and confidently interprets spectra of 18O-labeled peptides without requiring chemical composition information derived from production spectra. The algorithm is able to measure the effective 18O incorporation rate due to variable enzyme substrate specificity of the pseudosubstrater during the isotope exchange reaction and corrects for the 18O0 abundance that remains in the labeled sample when using a two-step digestion/labeling procedure. We have also incorporated a method for distinguishing pure 18O0 from pure 18O2 peptides utilizing impure H218O. The algorithm operates on centroided peak lists and is therefore very fast: nine chromatograms of, on average, 1,168 spectra and containing, on average, 6,761 isotopic clusters were interpreted in, on average, 45 s per chromatogram. RAAMS is fast enough (average, 38 ms/spectrum) to allow the possibility of performing information-dependent MS/MS on a chromatographic time scale on species exceeding predetermined ratio thresholds.

One of the main building blocks in this field of study is proteomics where tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in combination with isotopic labelling techniques provides a common way to obtain a direct insight into regulation at the protein level. Methods to identify and quantify the peptides contained in a sample are well established, and their output usually results in lists of identified proteins and calculated relative abundance values. The next step is to move ahead from these abstract lists and apply statistical inference methods to compare measurements, to identify genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated, or to detect clusters of proteins with similar expression profiles. Results: We introduce the Rich Internet Application (RIA) Qupe providing comprehensive data management and analysis functions for LC-MS/MS experiments. Starting with the import of mass spectra data the system guides the experimenter through the process of protein identification by database search, the calculation of protein abundance ratios, and in particular, the statistical evaluation of the quantification results including multivariate analysis methods such as analysis of variance or hierarchical cluster analysis. While a data model to store these results has been developed, a well-defined programming interface facilitates the integration of novel approaches. A compute cluster is utilized to distribute computationally intensive calculations, and a web service allows to interchange information with other -omics software applications.

However, it is often not considered that two opposing processes are responsible for the amount of a protein in a cell - the synthesis as well as the degradation. With this work, we provide an integrative, high-throughput method - from the experimental setup to the bioinformatics analysis - to measure synthesis and degradation rates of an organism's proteome. Applicability of the approach is demonstrated with an investigation of heat shock response, a well-understood regulatory mechanism in bacteria, on the biotechnologically relevant Corynebacterium glutamicum. Utilizing a multilabeling approach using both heavy stable nitrogen as well as carbon isotopes cells are metabolically labeled in a pulse-chase experiment to trace the labels' incorporation in newly synthesized proteins and its loss during protein degradation.

This technology yields information about the relative abundance of single peptides. A method for the calculation of reliable quantification information is required in order to obtain biologically relevant data at the protein expression level. Results: A method comprising sound error estimation and statistical methods is presented that allows precise abundance analysis plus error calculation at the peptide as well as at the protein level. This yields the relevant information that is required for quantitative proteomics. Comparing the performance of our method named Quant with existing approaches the error estimation is reliable and offers information for precise bioinformatic models. Quant is shown to generate results that are consistent with those produced by ProQuant™, thus validating both systems. Moreover, the results are consistent with that of Mascot™ 2.2. The MATLAB® scripts of Quant are freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de and http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/, each under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Conclusion: The software Quant demonstrates improvements in protein quantification using iTRAQ™. Precise quantification data can be obtained at the protein level when using error propagation and adequate visualization. Quant integrates both and additionally provides the possibility to obtain more reliable results by calculation of wise quality measures. Peak area integration has been replaced by sum of intensities, yielding more reliable quantification results. Additionally, Quant allows the combination of quantitative information obtained by iTRAQ™ with peptide and protein identifications from popular tandem MS identification tools. Hence Quant is a useful tool for the proteomics community and may help improving analysis of proteomic experimental data.

QPROT is an extension of the QSPEC suite, originally developed for spectral count data, adapted for the analysis using continuously measured protein-level intensity data. QPROT offers a new intensity normalization procedure and model-based differential expression analysis, both of which account for missing data. Determination of differential expression of each protein is based on the standardized Z-statistic based on the posterior distribution of the log fold change parameter, guided by the false discovery rate estimated by a well-known Empirical Bayes method. We evaluated the classification performance of QPROT using the quantification calibration data from the clinical proteomic technology assessment for cancer (CPTAC) study and a recently published Escherichia coli benchmark dataset, with evaluation of FDR accuracy in the latter. Biological significance: QPROT is a statistical framework with computational software tool for comparative quantitative proteomics analysis. It features various extensions of QSPEC method originally built for spectral count data analysis, including probabilistic treatment of missing values in protein intensity data.

RIP typically starts with ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins by extracellular membrane-bound proteases followed by intramembrane proteolysis of the resulting membrane-tethered fragment. However, for the majority of RIP proteases the corresponding substrates and thus, their functions, remain unknown. Proteome-wide identification of RIP protease substrates is possible by mass spectrometry-based quantitative comparison of RIP substrates or their cleavage products between different biological states. However, this requires quantification of peptides from only the ectodomain or cytoplasmic domain. Current analysis software does not allow matching peptides to either domain. Here we present the QARIP (Quantitative Analysis of Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis) web server which matches identified peptides to the protein transmembrane topology. QARIP allows determination of quantitative ratios separately for the topological domains (cytoplasmic, ectodomain) of a given protein and is thus a powerful tool for quality control, improvement of quantitative ratios and identification of novel substrates in proteomic RIP datasets. To our knowledge, the QARIP web server is the first tool directly addressing the phenomenon of RIP. The web server is available at http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/qarip/.

When multiple samples are profiled, including replicates of the same sample and/or different sample states, one needs to account for retention time drifts between experiments. This can be achieved either by the alignment of chromatographic profiles prior to peak detection, or by matching signal peaks after they have been extracted from chromatogram data matrices. Automated retention time correction is particularly important in non-targeted profiling studies. Results: A new approach for matching signal peaks based on dynamic programming is presented. The proposed approach relies on both peak retention times and mass spectra. The alignment of more than two peak lists involves three steps: (1) all possible pairs of peak lists are aligned, and similarity of each pair of peak lists is estimated; (2) the guide tree is built based on the similarity between the peak lists; (3) peak lists are progressively aligned starting with the two most similar peak lists, following the guide tree until all peak lists are exhausted. When two or more experiments are performed on different sample states and each consisting of multiple replicates, peak lists within each set of replicate experiments are aligned first (within-state alignment), and subsequently the resulting alignments are aligned themselves (between-state alignment). When more than two sets of replicate experiments are present, the between-state alignment also employs the guide tree. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on GC-MS metabolic profiling experiments acquired on wild-type and mutant Leishmania mexicana parasites. Conclusion: We propose a progressive method to match signal peaks across multiple GC-MS experiments based on dynamic programming. A sensitive peak similarity function is proposed to balance peak retention time and peak mass spectra similarities. This approach can produce the optimal alignment between an arbitrary number of peak lists, and models explicitly within-state and between-state peak alignment. The accuracy of the proposed method was close to the accuracy of manually-curated peak matching, which required tens of man-hours for the analyzed data sets. The proposed approach may offer significant advantages for processing of high-throughput metabolomics data, especially when large numbers of experimental replicates and multiple sample states are analyzed. © 2007 Robinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"A dynamic programming approach for the alignment of signal peaks in multiple gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments","authors":[{"name":"Robinson M.D."},{"name":"De Souza D.P."},{"name":"Keen W.W."},{"name":"Saunders E.C."},{"name":"McConville M.J."},{"name":"Speed T.P."},{"name":"Likic V.A."}]},"pmid":"17963529","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"netCDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3650"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2424"},{"term":"Filtering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3695"},{"term":"Aggregation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3436"},{"term":"Chromatographic alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3628"},{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]},{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"dat","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1637"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"dat","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1637"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"netCDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3650"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Chromatogram visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3203"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"V Likic","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"v.likic@gmail.com","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"M Robinson","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"mrobinson@wehi.edu.au","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyms-docs/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pyms","biotoolsID":"pyms","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:36:20Z","name":"PyMS","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:54Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://code.google.com/p/pyms/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/quantumjot/PyFolding/issues"}],"description":"A Python framework for graphing, analysis, and simulation of the biophysical properties of proteins.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":2,"date":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","journal":"Biophysical Journal","abstract":"© 2017 Biophysical SocietyFor many years, curve-fitting software has been heavily utilized to fit simple models to various types of biophysical data. Although such software packages are easy to use for simple functions, they are often expensive and present substantial impediments to applying more complex models or for the analysis of large data sets. One field that is reliant on such data analysis is the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated analytical models have been generated, but without simple tools to enable routine analysis. Consequently, users have needed to generate their own tools or otherwise find willing collaborators. Here we present PyFolding, a free, open-source, and extensible Python framework for graphing, analysis, and simulation of the biophysical properties of proteins. To demonstrate the utility of PyFolding, we have used it to analyze and model experimental protein folding and thermodynamic data. Examples include: 1) multiphase kinetic folding fitted to linked equations, 2) global fitting of multiple data sets, and 3) analysis of repeat protein thermodynamics with Ising model variants. Moreover, we demonstrate how PyFolding is easily extensible to novel functionality beyond applications in protein folding via the addition of new models.

In contrast, quantitative studies of transcript abundance often span hundreds of experimental conditions and replicates. This situation exists, in part, because extracting quantitative data from large proteomics datasets is significantly more difficult than reading quantitative data from a gene expression microarray. To address this problem, we introduce two algorithmic advances in the processing of quantitative proteomics data. First, we use spacepartitioning data structures to handle the large size of these datasets. Second, we introduce techniques that combine graphtheoretic algorithms with space-partitioning data structures to collect relative protein abundance data across hundreds of experimental conditions and replicates. We validate these algorithmic techniques by analyzing several datasets and computing both internal and external measures of quantification accuracy. We demonstrate the scalability of these techniques by applying them to a large dataset that comprises a total of 472 experimental conditions and replicates.","title":"Protein quantification across hundreds of experimental conditions","authors":[{"name":"Khan Z."},{"name":"Bloom J.S."},{"name":"Garci B.A."},{"name":"Singh M."},{"name":"Kruglyak L."}]},"pmid":"19717460","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0849"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Isotope-coded protein label","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3705"},{"term":"SILAC","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3638"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"},{"term":"Standardisation and normalisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"},{"term":"Metabolic labeling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3715"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"},{"term":"Label-free quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3634"},{"term":"Spectral counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"},{"term":"Chromatographic alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3628"},{"term":"Isotopic distributions calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3632"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Z Khan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"zkhan@princeton.edu","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-EE","proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/pview/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pview","biotoolsID":"pview","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:36:14Z","name":"PVIEW","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2814"},{"term":"Data visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:39Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/pview/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pulse-positive-unlabeled-learning-for-splicing-elucidation.html"}],"description":"Semi-supervised learning algorithm, positive unlabeled learning for splicing elucidation, which uses 48 features spanning various categories.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":12,"date":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","journal":"Cell Reports","abstract":"© 2015 The Authors.Alternative splicing acts on transcripts from almost all human multi-exon genes. Notwithstanding its ubiquity, fundamental ramifications of splicing on protein expression remain unresolved. The number and identity of spliced transcripts that form stably folded proteins remain the sources of considerable debate, due largely to low coverage of experimental methods and the resulting absence of negative data. We circumvent this issue by developing a semi-supervised learning algorithm, positive unlabeled learning for splicing elucidation (PULSE; http://www.kimlab.org/software/pulse), which uses 48 features spanning various categories. We validated its accuracy on sets of bona fide protein isoforms and directly on mass spectrometry (MS) spectra for an overall AU-ROC of 0.85. We predict that around 32% of \"exon skipping\" alternative splicing events produce stable proteins, suggesting that the process engenders a significant number of previously uncharacterized proteins. We also provide insights into the distribution of positive isoforms in various functional classes and into the structural effects of alternative splicing.","title":"Semi-supervised Learning Predicts Approximately One Third of the Alternative Splicing Isoforms as Functional Proteins","authors":[{"name":"Hao Y."},{"name":"Colak R."},{"name":"Teyra J."},{"name":"Corbi-Verge C."},{"name":"Ignatchenko A."},{"name":"Hahne H."},{"name":"Wilhelm M."},{"name":"Kuster B."},{"name":"Braun P."},{"name":"Kaida D."},{"name":"Kislinger T."},{"name":"Kim P.M."}]},"pmid":"26146086","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Splicing model analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2499"},{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"},{"term":"Protein function prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_1777"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.kimlab.org/contact","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.kimlab.org/software/pulse"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pulse","biotoolsID":"pulse","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:36:10Z","name":"PULSE","topic":[{"term":"RNA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0099"},{"term":"RNA splicing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3320"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:54:59Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.kimlab.org/software/pulse"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A program developed for identification of Post-Translational Modification in MS/MS data and it is embedded to the X!Tandem project.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":4,"date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry has become a standard tool for identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Algorithmic searches for PTMs from tandem mass spectrum data (MS/MS) tend to be hampered by noisy data as well as by a combinatorial explosion of search space. This leads to high uncertainty and long search-execution times.Results: To address this issue, we present PTMTreeSearch, a new algorithm that uses a large database of known PTMs to identify PTMs from MS/MS data. For a given peptide sequence, PTMTreeSearch builds a computational tree wherein each path from the root to the leaves is labeled with the amino acids of a peptide sequence. Branches then represent PTMs. Various empirical tree pruning rules have been designed to decrease the search-execution time by eliminating biologically unlikely solutions. PTMTreeSearch first identifies a relatively small set of high confidence PTM types, and in a second stage, performs a more exhaustive search on this restricted set using relaxed search parameter settings. An analysis of experimental data shows that using the same criteria for false discovery, PTMTreeSearch annotates more peptides than the current state-of-the-art methods and PTM identification algorithms, and achieves this at roughly the same execution time. PTMTreeSearch is implemented as a plugable scoring function in the X!Tandem search engine. © 2013 The Author.","title":"PTMTreeSearch: A novel two-stage tree-search algorithm with pruning rules for the identification of post-translational modification of proteins in MS/MS spectra","authors":[{"name":"Kertesz-Farkas A."},{"name":"Reiz B."},{"name":"Vera R."},{"name":"Myers M.P."},{"name":"Pongor S."}]},"pmid":"24215026","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTT642"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Post-translation modification site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Support","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"contact@thegpm.org","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://wiki.thegpm.org/wiki/Main_Page"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ptmtreesearch","biotoolsID":"ptmtreesearch","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:36:08Z","name":"PTMTreeSearch","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0108"}],"additionDate":"2018-04-26T15:20:50Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://pongor.itk.ppke.hu/ptmtreesearch/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Tool to model the confidence with which mass modifications are correctly localized for each peptide.

Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality.

As such, there is considerable interest in methods to comprehensively characterize proteolytic pathways in biological systems. Here, we describe a robust and versatile proteomic platform that enables direct visualization of the topography and magnitude of proteolytic events on a global scale. We use this method to generate a proteome-wide map of proteolytic events induced by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This profile contained 91 characterized caspase substrates as well as 170 additional proteins not previously known to be cleaved during apoptosis. Surprisingly, the vast majority of proteolyzed proteins, regardless of the extent of cleavage, yielded persistent fragments that correspond to discrete protein domains, suggesting that the generation of active effector proteins may be a principal function of apoptotic proteolytic cascades. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

PROTICdb has been developed to be as independent as possible from tools used to produce the data. Biological samples and proteomics data are described using ontology terms. A Taverna workflow is embedded, thus permitting to automatically retrieve information related to identified proteins by querying external databases. Stored data can be displayed graphically and a \"Query Builder\" allows users to make sophisticated queries without knowledge on the underlying database structure. All resources can be accessed programmatically using a Java client API or RESTful web services, allowing the integration of PROTICdb in any portal. An example of application is presented, where proteins extracted from a maize leaf sample by four different methods were compared using a label-free shotgun method.

Although SEQUEST and Mascot perform a conceptually similar task to the tool BLAST, the key algorithmic idea of BLAST (filtration) was never implemented in these tools. As a result MS/MS protein identification tools are becoming too time-consuming for many applications including search for post-translationally modified peptides. Moreover, matching millions of spectra against all known proteins will soon make these tools too slow in the same way that \"genome vs genome\" comparisons instantly made BLAST too slow. We describe the development of filters for MS/MS database searches that dramatically reduce the running time and effectively remove the bottlenecks in searching the huge space of protein modifications.

The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes.

However, this approach is only rarely used, mainly because it requires additional sample and mass spectrometric measurement time. We have previously described Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP), a type of proteomic reactor, in which samples dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are digested in an ultrafiltration unit. In FASP, such as in any other preparation protocol, a portion of sample remains after digestion and peptide elution. Making use of this fact, we here develop a protocol enabling consecutive digestion of the sample with two or three enzymes. By use of the FASP method, peptides are liberated after each digestion step and remaining material is subsequently cleaved with the next proteinase. We observed excellent performance of the ultrafiltration devices in this mode, allowing efficient separation of orthogonal populations of peptides, resulting in an increase in the numbers of identified peptides and proteins. At the low microgram level, we found that the consecutive use of endoproteinases LysC and trypsin enabled identification of up to 40% more proteins and phosphorylation sites in comparison to the commonly used one-step tryptic digestion. MED-FASP offers efficient exploration of previously unused sample material, increasing depth of proteomic analyses and sequence coverage. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","title":"Consecutive proteolytic digestion in an enzyme reactor increases depth of proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis","authors":[{"name":"Wisniewski J.R."},{"name":"Mann M."}]},"pmid":"22324799","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Proteolytic digest","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1238"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence (raw)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2974"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"},{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein cleavage site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0422"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/jgmeyerucsd/ProteomeDigestSim"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:proteomedigestsim","biotoolsID":"proteomedigestsim","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:34:58Z","name":"ProteomeDigestSim","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein properties","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0123"},{"term":"Protein hydropathy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0137"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:52Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/jgmeyerucsd/ProteomeDigestSim"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"The database of pre-computed isoelectric points for proteomes from different model organisms (5029 species).

However, there are some technical and practical challenges to overcome, since proteogenomics requires pipelines comprising a complex set of interconnected modules as well as bespoke routines, for example in protein inference and statistics. We are introducing a complete, open source pipeline for proteogenomics, called ProteoAnnotator, which incorporates a graphical user interface and implements the Proteomics Standards Initiative mzIdentML standard for each analysis stage. All steps are included as standalone modules with the mzIdentML library, allowing other groups to re-use the whole pipeline or constituent parts within other tools. We have developed new modules for pre-processing and combining multiple search databases, for performing peptide-level statistics on mzIdentML files, for scoring grouped protein identifications matched to a given genomic locus to validate that updates to the official gene models are statistically sound and for mapping end results back onto the genome.","title":"ProteoAnnotator - Open source proteogenomics annotation software supporting PSI standards","authors":[{"name":"Ghali F."},{"name":"Krishna R."},{"name":"Perkins S."},{"name":"Collins A."},{"name":"Xia D."},{"name":"Wastling J."},{"name":"Jones A.R."}]},"pmid":"25297486","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1002/PMIC.201400265"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Gene functional annotation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3672"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Andrew Jones","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"Andrew.Jones@liv.ac.uk","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.proteoannotator.org/?q=node/35"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:proteoannotator","biotoolsID":"proteoannotator","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:34:46Z","name":"ProteoAnnotator","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Data submission, annotation and curation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0219"}],"additionDate":"2018-05-23T15:33:52Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.proteoannotator.org/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Peptides that were identified, in collaboration, by Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) and Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC).\n\nWe interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases, irrespective of tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments.

Here, we attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and find that there is a single dominant protein isoform, irrespective of tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments, in partial agreement with the conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study.

However, for microorganisms the genomic divergence quickly becomes large, resulting in different codon usage and shuffling of gene order and gene elements such as exons. Results: We present Proteny, a methodology to detect synteny between diverged genomes. It operates on the amino acid sequence level to be insensitive to codon usage adaptations and clusters groups of exons disregarding order to handle diversity in genomic ordering between genomes. Furthermore, Proteny assigns significance levels to the syntenic clusters such that they can be selected on statistical grounds. Finally, Proteny provides novel ways to visualize results at different scales, facilitating the exploration and interpretation of syntenic regions. We test the performance of Proteny on a standard ground truth dataset, and we illustrate the use of Proteny on two closely related genomes (two different strains of Aspergillus niger) and on two distant genomes (two species of Basidiomycota). In comparison to other tools, we find that Proteny finds clusters with more true homologies in fewer clusters that contain more genes, i.e. Proteny is able to identify a more consistent synteny. Further, we show how genome rearrangements, assembly errors, gene duplications and the conservation of specific genes can be easily studied with Proteny.

The proteomics field would benefit from user-friendly analysis and data management platforms in which method developers can make their analysis tools available for the community. Here, we describe the Proteios Software Environment (ProSE) that is built around a Web-based local data repository for proteomics experiments. The application features sample tracking, project sharing between multiple users, and automated data merging and analysis. ProSE has built-in support for several quantitative proteomics workflows, and integrates searching in several search engines, automated combination of the search results with predetermined false discovery rates, annotation of proteins and submission of results to public repositories.

Despite many technological and computational advances, the results of a mass spectrometry proteomics experiment are still subject to a large variability. For the understanding and evaluation of how technical variability affects the results of an experiment, several computationally derived quality control metrics have been introduced. However, despite the availability of these metrics, a systematic approach to quality control is often still lacking because the metrics are not fully understood and are hard to interpret. Here, we present a toolkit of powerful techniques to analyze and interpret multivariate quality control metrics to assess the quality of mass spectrometry proteomics experiments. We show how unsupervised techniques applied to these quality control metrics can provide an initial discrimination between low-quality experiments and high-quality experiments prior to manual investigation. Furthermore, we provide a technique to obtain detailed information on the quality control metrics that are related to the decreased performance, which can be used as actionable information to improve the experimental setup.

The success of proteomics studies depends on the ability to accurately and efficiently identify proteins. Many methods have been proposed to facilitate the identification of proteins from peptide identification results. However, the relationship between protein identification and peptide identification has not been thoroughly explained before. In this paper, we devote ourselves to a combinatorial perspective of the protein inference problem. We employ combinatorial mathematics to calculate the conditional protein probabilities (protein probability means the probability that a protein is correctly identified) under three assumptions, which lead to a lower bound, an upper bound, and an empirical estimation of protein probabilities, respectively. The combinatorial perspective enables us to obtain an analytical expression for protein inference. Our method achieves comparable results with ProteinProphet in a more efficient manner in experiments on two data sets of standard protein mixtures and two data sets of real samples. Based on our model, we study the impact of unique peptides and degenerate peptides (degenerate peptides are peptides shared by at least two proteins) on protein probabilities. Meanwhile, we also study the relationship between our model and ProteinProphet. We name our program ProteinInfer.

By searching an MS spectrum against a given protein database, the most matched proteins are sorted using a scoring function and the top one is often considered the correctly identified protein. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) is one of the major methods for protein identification using MS technology. It is faster and cheaper than the other popular technique - Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Key bioinformatics issues in PMF analysis include designing a scoring function to quantitatively measure the degree of consistency between a PMF spectrum and a protein sequence and assessing the confidence of identified proteins. In this chapter, we will introduce several scoring functions that were developed by others and us. We will also provide a new statistic model to evaluate the confidence of the score and make an improvement for ranking proteins in protein identification.

Redundant and homologous protein sequences present a challenge in being correctly identified, as a set of peptides may in many cases represent multiple proteins. One simple solution to this problem is the assignment of the smallest number of proteins that explains the identified peptides. However, it is not certain that a natural system should be accurately represented using this minimalist approach. In this paper, we propose a reformulation of the protein inference problem by utilizing the recently introduced concept of peptide detectability. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real proteomics data. In comparison to a greedy implementation of the minimum protein set algorithm, our solution that incorporates peptide detectability performs favorably. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

Four main components of ProSight PTM are a database retrieval algorithm (Retriever), MySQL protein databases, a file/data manager, and a project tracker. Retriever performs probability-based identifications from absolute fragment ion masses, automatically compiled sequence tags, or a combination of the two, with graphical rendering and browsing of the results. The database structure allows known and putative protein forms to be searched, with prior or predicted PTM knowledge used during each search. Initial functionality is illustrated with a 36-kDa yeast protein identified from a processed cell extract after automated data acquisition using a quadrupole-FT hybrid mass spectrometer. A +142-Da Δm on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was automatically localized between Asp90 and Asp192, consistent with its two cystine residues (149 and 153) alkylated by acrylamide (+71 Da each) during the gel-based sample preparation.

Previously, we have shown that the estimation variability and bias of peptide abundance ratios can be predicted from their profile signal-to-noise ratios. Given multiple quantified peptides for a protein, the profile likelihood algorithm probabilistically weighs the peptide abundance ratios by their inferred estimation variability, accounts for their expected estimation bias, and suppresses contribution from outliers. This algorithm yields maximum likelihood point estimation and profile likelihood confidence interval estimation of protein abundance ratios. This point estimator is more accurate than an estimator based on the average of peptide abundance ratios. The confidence interval estimation provides an \"error bar\" for each protein abundance ratio that reflects its estimation precision and statistical uncertainty. The accuracy of the point estimation and the precision and confidence level of the interval estimation were benchmarked with standard mixtures of isotopically labeled proteomes.

PTMs of proteins control many biological regulatory and signaling mechanisms and 2D gel electrophoresis is able to resolve many PTM-induced isoforms, such as those due to phosphorylation, acetylation, deamination, alkylation, cysteine oxidation or tyrosine nitration. These modifications cause changes in the pI of the protein by adding, removing or changing titratable groups. Proteins differ widely in buffering capacity and pI and therefore the same PTMs may give rise to quite different patterns of pI shifts in different proteins. It is impossible by visual inspection of a pattern of spots on a gel to determine which modifications are most likely to be present.

Emerging evidence suggests that the dynamic range of protein abundance is greater than that observed at the transcript level. Technological breakthroughs now mean that sequencing-based measurement of mRNA levels is routine, but protocols for measuring protein abundance remain both complex and expensive. This paper introduces a Bayesian network that integrates transcriptomic and proteomic data to predict protein abundance and to model the effects of its determinants. We aim to use this model to follow a molecular response over time, from condition-specific data, in order to understand adaptation during processes such as the cell cycle. With microarray data now available for many conditions, the general utility of a protein abundance predictor is broad. Whereas most quantitative proteomics studies have focused on higher organisms, we developed a predictive model of protein abundance for both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe to explore the latitude at the protein level. Our predictor primarily relies on mRNA level, mRNA-protein interaction, mRNA folding energy and half-life, and tRNA adaptation. The combination of key features, allowing for the low certainty and uneven coverage of experimental observations, gives comparativelyminor but robust prediction accuracy. The model substantially improved the analysis of protein regulation during the cell cycle: predicted protein abundance identified twice as many cell-cycle-associated proteins as experimental mRNA levels. Predicted protein abundance was more dynamic than observed mRNA expression, agreeing with experimental protein abundance from a human cell line. We illustrate how the same model can be used to predict the folding energy of mRNA when protein abundance is available, lending credence to the emerging view that mRNA folding affects translation efficiency.

Nevertheless, current identification methods from spectrometric data have difficulties in handling modifications or mutations in the source peptide. Moreover, they have low performance when run on large databases (such as genomic databases), or with low quality data, for example due to bad calibration or low fragmentation of the source peptide. We present a new algorithm dedicated to automated protein identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data by searching a peptide sequence database. Our identification approach shows promising properties for solving the specific difficulties enumerated above. It consists of matching theoretical peptide sequences issued from a database with a structured representation of the source MS/MS spectrum. The representation is similar to the spectrum graphs commonly used by de novo sequencing software. The identification process involves the parsing of the graph in order to emphazise relevant sections for each theoretical sequence, and leads to a list of peptides ranked by a correlation score. The parsing of the graph, which can be a highly combinatorial task, is performed by a bio-inspired algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.","title":"Popitam: Towards new heuristic strategies to improve protein identification from tandem mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Hernandez P."},{"name":"Gras R."},{"name":"Frey J."},{"name":"Appel R.D."}]},"pmid":"12833510","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"},{"term":"dta","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3652"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2886"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"PTM identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3645"},{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"},{"term":"Tag-based peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3643"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"},{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"de Novo sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3644"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Patricia Hernandez","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"patricia.hernandez@isb-sib.ch","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/chernan/popitam"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:popitam","biotoolsID":"popitam","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:32:40Z","name":"Popitam","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:13Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/chernan/popitam"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/plink-ss-identification-of-disulfide-bond-peptides.html"}],"description":"High-throughput mass spectrometry method for precise identification of disulfide-linked peptides.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":43,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"We developed a high-throughput mass spectrometry method, pLink-SS (http://pfind.ict.ac.cn/software/pLink/2014/pLink-SS.html), for precise identification of disulfide-linked peptides.

Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Drift tube ion mobility spectrometry coupled with mass spectrometry (DTIMS-MS) is increasingly implemented in high throughput omics workflows, and new informatics approaches are necessary for processing the associated data. To automatically extract arrival times for molecules measured by DTIMS at multiple electric fields and compute their associated collisional cross sections (CCS), we created the PNNL Ion Mobility Cross Section Extractor (PIXiE). The primary application presented for this algorithm is the extraction of data that can then be used to create a reference library of experimental CCS values for use in high throughput omics analyses. Results: We demonstrate the utility of this approach by automatically extracting arrival times and calculating the associated CCSs for a set of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. The PIXiE-generated CCS values were within error of those calculated using commercially available instrument vendor software.

The fate of an infected bacterium is determined by the bacteriophage proteins located in the host cell. Thus, reliably identifying bacteriophage proteins located in the host cell is extremely important to understand their functions and discover potential anti-bacterial drugs. Thus, in this paper, a computational method was developed to recognize bacteriophage proteins located in host cells based only on their amino acid sequences. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with incremental feature selection (IFS) was proposed to optimize the feature set. Using a jackknife cross-validation, our method can discriminate between bacteriophage proteins located in a host cell and the bacteriophage proteins not located in a host cell with a maximum overall accuracy of 84.2%, and can further classify bacteriophage proteins located in host cell cytoplasm and in host cell membranes with a maximum overall accuracy of 92.4%. To enhance the value of the practical applications of the method, we built a web server called PHPred (〈. http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/PHPred〉).

To answer biologically relevant questions from these complex data sets, it becomes essential to apply computational, statistical, and predictive analytical methods. Here we provide an advanced bioinformatic platform termed \"PhosphoSiteAnalyzer\" to explore large phosphoproteomic data sets that have been subjected to kinase prediction using the previously published NetworKIN algorithm. NetworKIN applies sophisticated linear motif analysis and contextual network modeling to obtain kinase-substrate associations with high accuracy and sensitivity.

PhosPhAt is now more of a web application with the inclusion of advanced search functions allowing combinatorial searches by Boolean terms. The results output now includes interactive visualization of annotated fragmentation spectra and the ability to export spectra and peptide sequences as text files for use in other applications. We have also implemented dynamic links to other web resources thus augmenting PhosPhAt-specific information with external protein-related data. For experimental phosphorylation sites with information about dynamic behavior in response to external stimuli, we display simple time-resolved diagrams. We have included predictions for pT and pY sites and updated pS predictions. Access to prediction algorithm now allows 'on-the-fly' prediction of phosphorylation of any user-uploaded protein sequence. Protein Pfam domain structures are now mapped onto the protein sequence display next to experimental and predicted phosphorylation sites.

Previously, the tools to do this have been limited to custom scripts designed by individual research groups to analyze their own data, are generally not widely available, and do not scale well with large eukaryotic genomes.Results: The Proteogenomic Mapping Tool includes a Java implementation of the Aho-Corasick string searching algorithm which takes as input standardized file types and rapidly searches experimentally observed peptides against a given genome translated in all 6 reading frames for exact matches.

The process starts with the digestion of the protein mixture into peptides, which are then separated by liquid chromatography and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). At the end of the workflow, recovering the identity of the proteins originally present in the sample is often a difficult and ambiguous process, because more than one protein identifier may match a set of peptides identified from the MS/MS spectra. To address this identification problem, many MS/MS data processing software tools combine all plausible protein identifiers matching a common set of peptides into a protein group. However, this solution introduces new challenges in studies with multiple experimental runs, which can be characterized by three main factors: i) protein groups' identifiers are local, i.e., they vary run to run, ii) the composition of each group may change across runs, and iii) the supporting evidence of proteins within each group may also change across runs. Since in general there is no conclusive evidence about the absence of proteins in the groups, protein groups need to be linked across different runs in subsequent statistical analyses. We propose an algorithm, called Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA), to link groups from multiple experimental runs by forming global protein groups from connected local groups. The algorithm is computationally inexpensive and enables the connection and analysis of lists of protein groups across runs needed in biomarkers studies. We illustrate the identification problem and the stability of the PGCA mapping using 65 iTRAQ experimental runs. Further, we use two biomarker studies to show how PGCA enables the discovery of relevant candidate protein group markers with similar but non-identical compositions in different runs.","title":"PGCA: An algorithm to link protein groups created from MS/MS data","authors":[{"name":"Kepplinger D."},{"name":"Takhar M."},{"name":"Sasaki M."},{"name":"Hollander Z."},{"name":"Smith D."},{"name":"McManus B."},{"name":"McMaster W.R."},{"name":"Ng R.T."},{"name":"Freue G.V.C."}]},"pmid":"28562641","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC5451011","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0177569"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data handling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Gabriela Cohen-Freue","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"gcohen@stat.ubc.ca","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/pgca/man/pgca.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.4.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pgca","biotoolsID":"pgca","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:31:47Z","name":"pgca","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-25T08:58:57Z","collectionID":["Proteomics","BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pgca.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Computational platform for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including pFind , pNovo and pQuant.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":122,"date":"2007-09-19T00:00:00Z","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"This paper describes the pFind 2.0 software package for peptide and protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry. Firstly, the most important feature of pFind 2.0 is that it offers a modularized and customized platform for third parties to test and compare their algorithms. The developers can create their own modules following the open application programming interface (API) standards and then add it into workflows in place of the default modules. In addition, to accommodate different requirements, the package provides four automated workflows adopting different algorithm modules, executing processes and result reports. Based on this design, pFind 2.0 provides an automated target-decoy database search strategy: The user can just specify a certain false positive rate (FPR) and start searching. Then the system will return the protein identification results automatically filtered by such an estimated FPR. Secondly, pFind 2.0 is also of high accuracy and high speed. Many pragmatic preprocessing, peptide-scoring, validation, and protein inference algorithms have been incorporated. To speed up the searching process, a toolbox for indexing protein databases is developed for high-throughput applications and all modules are implemented under a new architecture designed for large-scale parallel and distributed searching. An experiment on a public dataset shows that pFind 2.0 can identify more peptides than SEQUEST and Mascot at the 1% FPR. It is also demonstrated that this version of pFind 2.0 has better usability and higher speed than its previous versions.

However, neither the accuracy nor the efficiency of de novo sequencing has been satisfactory, mainly due to incomplete fragmentation information in experimental spectra. Recent advancement in MS technology has enabled acquisition of higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) spectra of the same precursor. These spectra contain complementary fragmentation information and can be collected with high resolution and high mass accuracy. Taking these advantages, we have developed a new algorithm called pNovo+, which greatly improves the accuracy and speed of de novo sequencing. On tryptic peptides, 86% of the topmost candidate sequences deduced by pNovo+ from HCD + ETD spectral pairs matched the database search results, and the success rate reached 95% if the top three candidates were included, which was much higher than using only HCD (87%) or only ETD spectra (57%). On Asp-N, Glu-C, or Elastase digested peptides, 69-87% of the HCD + ETD spectral pairs were correctly identified by pNovo+ among the topmost candidates, or 84-95% among the top three. On average, it takes pNovo+ only 0.018 s to extract the sequence from a spectrum or spectral pair on a common personal computer. This is more than three times as fast as other de novo sequencing programs. The increase of speed is mainly due to pDAG, a component algorithm of pNovo+. pDAG finds the k longest paths in a directed acyclic graph without the antisymmetry restriction. We have verified that the antisymmetry restriction is unnecessary for high resolution, high mass accuracy data. The extensive use of HCD and ETD spectral information and the pDAG algorithm make pNovo+ an excellent de novo sequencing tool. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","title":"PNovo+: De novo peptide sequencing using complementary HCD and ETD tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Chi H."},{"name":"Chen H."},{"name":"He K."},{"name":"Wu L."},{"name":"Yang B."},{"name":"Sun R.-X."},{"name":"Liu J."},{"name":"Zeng W.-F."},{"name":"Song C.-Q."},{"name":"He S.-M."},{"name":"Dong M.-Q."}]},"pmid":"23272783","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":23,"date":"2014-06-03T00:00:00Z","journal":"Analytical Chemistry","abstract":"In relative protein abundance determination from peptide intensities recorded in full mass scans, a major complication that affects quantitation accuracy is signal interference from coeluting ions of similar m/z values. Here, we present pQuant, a quantitation software tool that solves this problem. pQuant detects interference signals, identifies for each peptide a pair of least interfered isotopic chromatograms: one for the light and one for the heavy isotope-labeled peptide. On the basis of these isotopic pairs, pQuant calculates the relative heavy/light peptide ratios along with their 99.75% confidence intervals (CIs). From the peptides ratios and their CIs, pQuant estimates the protein ratios and associated CIs by kernel density estimation. We tested pQuant, Census and MaxQuant on data sets obtained from mixtures (at varying mixing ratios from 10:1 to 1:10) of light- and heavy-SILAC labeled HeLa cells or 14N- and 15N-labeled Escherichia coli cells. pQuant quantitated more peptides with better accuracy than Census and MaxQuant in all 14 data sets.

An important subclass of these motifs are characterized by a high proline content and play a pivotal role in biological processes requiring the coordinated assembly of multi-protein complexes. This is achieved via interaction of proteins containing modules such as Src Homology-3 (SH3) or WW domains and specific proline rich patterns. Here we make available via a publicly accessible database a synopsis of our current understanding of the interaction landscape of the human SH3 protein family. This is achieved by integrating an information extraction strategy with a new experimental approach. In a first approach we have used a text mining strategy to capture a large number of manuscripts reporting interactions between SH3 domains and target peptides. Relevant information was annotated in the MINT database. In a second experimental approach we have used a variant of the WISE (Whole Interactome Scanning Experiment) strategy to probe a large number of naturally occurring and chemically-synthesized peptides arrayed at high density on a glass surface. By this method we have tested 60 human SH3 domains for their ability to bind a collection of 9192 poly-proline containing peptides immobilized on a glass chip. To evaluate the quality of the resulting interaction dataset, we retested some of the interactions on a smaller scale and performed a series of pull down experiments on native proteins. Peptide chips, pull down assays, SPOT synthesis and phage display experiments have allowed us to further characterize the specificity and promiscuity of proline-rich binding domains and to map their interaction network.

By utilising hydroponic media that contain 15N inorganic salts as the sole nitrogen source, near to 100% 15N-labelling of proteins can be achieved. In this study, it is shown that HILEP, in combination with mass spectrometry, is suitable for relative protein quantitation of seven week-old Arabidopsis plants submitted to oxidative stress. Protein extracts from pooled 14N- and 15N-hydroponically grown plants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, digested and analysed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins were identified and the spectra of 14N/15N peptide pairs were extracted using their m/z chromatographic retention time, isotopic distributions, and the m/z difference between the 14N and 15N peptides. Relative amounts were calculated as the ratio of the sum of the peak areas of the two distinct 14N and 15N peptide isotope envelopes. Using Mascot and the open source trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP), the data processing was automated for global proteome quantitation down to the isoform level by extracting isoform specific peptides. With this combination of metabolic labelling and mass spectrometry it was possible to show differential protein expression in the apoplast of plants submitted to oxidative stress. Moreover, it was possible to discriminate between differentially expressed isoforms belonging to the same protein family, such as isoforms of xylanases and pathogen-related glucanases (PR 2). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

They occur in regions where the score distributions of true positives and true negatives overlap. Removal of these false positive identifications necessarily involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Existing postprocessing tools typically rely on a fixed or semifixed set of assumptions in their attempts to optimize both the sensitivity and the specificity of peptide and protein identification using MS/MS spectra. Because of the expanding diversity in available proteomics technologies, however, these postprocessing tools often struggle to adapt to emerging technology-specific peculiarity. Here we present a novel tool named Peptizer that solves this adaptability issue by making use of pluggable assumptions. This research-oriented postprocessing tool also includes a graphical user interface to perform efficient manual validation of suspect identifications for optimal sensitivity recovery.

Improving peptide identification results by ranking true Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) over their false counterparts leads to the development of various reranking algorithms. In peptide reranking, discriminative information is essential to distinguish true PSMs from false PSMs. Generally, most peptide reranking methods obtain discriminative information directly from database search scores or by training machine learning models. Information in the protein database and MS1 spectra (i.e., single stage MS spectra) is ignored. In this paper, we propose to use information in the protein database and MS1 spectra to rerank peptide identification results. To quantitatively analyze their effects to peptide reranking results, three peptide reranking methods are proposed: PPMRanker, PPIRanker, and MIRanker. PPMRanker only uses Protein-Peptide Map (PPM) information from the protein database, PPIRanker only uses Precursor Peak Intensity (PPI) information, and MIRanker employs both PPM information and PPI information. According to our experiments on a standard protein mixture data set, a human data set and a mouse data set, PPMRanker and MIRanker achieve better peptide reranking results than PetideProphet, PeptideProphet+NSP (number of sibling peptides) and a score regularization method SRPI.

Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.","title":"Empirical statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search","authors":[{"name":"Keller A."},{"name":"Nesvizhskii A.I."},{"name":"Kolker E."},{"name":"Aebersold R."}]},"pmid":"12403597","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"},{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"pepXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3655"},{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Statistical modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3664"},{"term":"Variant filtering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3675"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"nesvi@umich.edu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"nesvi@umich.edu","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"akeller@systemsbiology.org","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"akeller@systemsbiology.org","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:PeptideProphet"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:peptideprophet","biotoolsID":"peptideprophet","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:31:04Z","name":"PeptideProphet","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:29Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://peptideprophet.sourceforge.net/index.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Cleaves a protein sequence with a chosen enzyme and computes masses of the generated peptides.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":246,"date":"1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Electrophoresis","abstract":"In peptide mass fingerprinting, there are frequently peptides whose masses cannot be explained. These are usually attributed to either a missed cleavage site during the chemical or enzymatic cutting process, the lack of reduction and alkylation of a protein, protein modifications like the oxidation of methionine, or the presence of protein post-translational modifications. However, they could equally be due to database errors, unusual splicing events, variants of a protein in a population, or artifactual protein modifications. Unfortunately the verification of each of these possibilities can be tedious and time-consuming. To better utilize annotated protein databases for the understanding of peptide mass fingerprinting data, we have written the program 'PEPTIDEMASS'. This program generates the theoretical peptide masses of any protein in the SWISS-PROT database, or of any sequence specified by the user. If the sequence is derived from the SWISS-PROT database, the program takes into account any annotations for that protein in order to generate the peptide masses. In this manner, the user can obtain the predicted masses of peptides from proteins which are known to have signal sequences, propeptides, transit peptides, simple post-translational modifications, and disulfide bonds. Users are also warned if any peptide masses are subject to change from protein isoforms, database conflicts, or an mRNA splicing variation.

Tandem mass spectrometry allows for high-throughput identification of complex protein samples. Searching tandem mass spectra against sequence databases is the main analysis method nowadays. Since many peptide variations are possible, including them in the search space seems only logical. However, the search space usually grows exponentially with the number of independent variations and may therefore overwhelm computational resources. Results: We provide fast, cache-efficient search algorithms to screen large peptide search spaces including non-tryptic peptides, whole genomes, dozens of posttranslational modifications, unannotated point mutations and even unannotated splice sites. All these search spaces can be screened simultaneously. By optimizing the cache usage, we achieve a calculation speed that closely approaches the limits of the hardware. At the same time, we control the size of the overall search space by limiting the combinations of variations that can co-occur on the same peptide. Using a hypergeometric scoring scheme, we applied these algorithms to a dataset of 1 420 632 spectra. We were able to identify a considerable number of peptide variations within a modest amount of computing time on standard desktop computers. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.

Therefore, mass spectrometry-based approaches, such as limited proteolysis, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and stable-isotope labeling, are frequently used to characterize protein conformation and dynamics, yet the interpretation of these data can be cumbersome and time consuming.

The approach, however, can be laborious, as it often requires search segmentation and the use of several unintegrated tools. Furthermore, many proteogenomic efforts have been limited to small genomes, as large genomes can prove impractical due to the required amount of computer memory and computation time. We present Peppy, a software tool designed to perform every necessary task of proteogenomic searches quickly, accurately and automatically. The software generates a peptide database from a genome, tracks peptide loci, matches peptides to MS/MS spectra and assigns confidence values to those matches. Peppy automatically performs a decoy database generation, search and analysis to return identifications at the desired false discovery rate threshold.

Recently, an innovative mass-spectrometry-based strategy, peptidogenomics, has been pioneered to effectively mine microbial strains for novel peptidic metabolites. Even though mass-spectrometric peptide detection can be performed quite fast, true high-throughput natural product discovery approaches have still been limited by the inability to rapidly match the identified tandem mass spectra to the gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of the corresponding compounds. With Pep2Path, we introduce a software package to fully automate the peptidogenomics approach through the rapid Bayesian probabilistic matching of mass spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters. Detailed benchmarking of the method shows that the approach is powerful enough to correctly identify gene clusters even in data sets that consist of hundreds of genomes, which also makes it possible to match compounds from unsequenced organisms to closely related biosynthetic gene clusters in other genomes. Applying Pep2Path to a data set of compounds without known biosynthesis routes, we were able to identify candidate gene clusters for the biosynthesis of five important compounds. Notably, one of these clusters was detected in a genome from a different subphylum of Proteobacteria than that in which the molecule had first been identified. All in all, our approach paves the way towards high-throughput discovery of novel peptidic natural products.

The most common approaches rely on the available databases to match experimental MS/MS data. These methods suffer from several drawbacks and cannot be used for the identification of proteins from unknown genomes. In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, PEAKS, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. PEAKS uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the MS/MS spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of PEAKS is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.

Those tags are then used to match, accounting amino acid mutations, the sequences in a protein database. If the de novo sequencing gives correct tags, the homologs of the proteins can be identified by this approach and software such as MS-BLAST is available for the matching. However, de novo sequencing very often gives only partially correct tags. The most common error is that a segment of amino acids is replaced by another segment with approximately the same masses. We developed a new efficient algorithm to match sequence tags with errors to database sequences for the purpose of protein and peptide identification.

To address this issue, a wide range of stable isotope labeling techniques have been developed, allowing one to quantitatively study thousands of proteins by means of mass spectrometry. In this article, the FindPairs module of the PeakQuant software suite is detailed. It facilitates the automatic determination of protein abundance ratios based on the automated analysis of stable isotope-coded mass spectrometric data. Furthermore, it implements statistical methods to determine outliers due to biological as well as technical variance of proteome data obtained in replicate experiments. This provides an important means to evaluate the significance in obtained protein expression data. For demonstrating the high applicability of FindPairs, we focused on the quantitative analysis of proteome data acquired in 14N/15N labeling experiments. We further provide a comprehensive overview of the features of the FindPairs software, and compare these with existing quantification packages.

However, only a small number of peptides can be identified and linked by tandem MS in two runs, and it becomes necessary to link peptide peaks with tandem identification in one run to their corresponding ones in another run without identification. In the past, peptide peaks are linked based on similarities in retention time (rt), mass or peak shape after rt alignment, which corrects mean rt shifts between runs. However, the accuracy in linking is still limited especially for complex samples collected from different conditions. Consequently, large-scale proteomics studies that require comparison of protein expression profiles of hundreds of patients can not be carried out effectively. Method: In this article, we consider the problem of linking peptides from a pair of LC-MS/MS runs and propose a new method, PeakLink (PL), which uses information in both the time and frequency domain as inputs to a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The PL algorithm first uses a threshold on an rt likelihood ratio score to remove candidate corresponding peaks with excessively large elution time shifts, then PL calculates the correlation between a pair of candidate peaks after reducing noise through wavelet transformation. After converting rt and peak shape correlation to statistical scores, an SVM classifier is trained and applied for differentiating corresponding and non-corresponding peptide peaks. Results: PL is tested in multiple challenging cases, in which LC-MS/ MS samples are collected from different disease states, different instruments and different laboratories. Testing results show significant improvement in linking accuracy compared with other algorithms.. © The Author(s) 2014.","title":"PeakLink: A new peptide peak linking method in LC-MS/MS using wavelet and SVM","authors":[{"name":"Bari M.G."},{"name":"Ma X."},{"name":"Zhang J."}]},"pmid":"24813213","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLink/","email":"michelle.zhang@utsa.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLink/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:peaklink","biotoolsID":"peaklink","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:29:53Z","name":"PeakLink","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:55:21Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/zgroup/PeakLink/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Multiple-enzyme ''in silico'' digester for experimental design.","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein sequence cleavage","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0366"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"V.Z.

Liu et al. demonstrated a method to perform semi-relative protein quantitation in shotgun proteomics data by correlating the number of tandem mass spectra obtained for each protein, or \"spectral count\", with its abundance in a mixture; however, two issues have remained open: how to normalize spectral counting data and how to efficiently pinpoint differences between profiles. Moreover, Chen et al. recently showed how to increase the number of identified proteins in shotgun proteomics by analyzing samples with different MS-compatible detergents while performing proteolytic digestion. The latter introduced new challenges as seen from the data analysis perspective, since replicate readings are not acquired. Results: To address the open issues above, we present a program termed PatternLab for proteomics. This program implements existing strategies and adds two new methods to pinpoint differences in protein profiles. The first method, ACFold, addresses experiments with less than three replicates from each state or having assays acquired by different protocols as described by Chen et al. ACFold uses a combined criterion based on expression fold changes, the AC test, and the false-discovery rate, and can supply a \"bird's-eye view\" of differentially expressed proteins. The other method addresses experimental designs having multiple readings from each state and is referred to as nSVM (natural support vector machine) because of its roots in evolutionary computing and in statistical learning theory. Our observations suggest that nSVM's niche comprises projects that select a minimum set of proteins for classification purposes; for example, the development of an early detection kit for a given pathology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each method on experimental data and confront them with existing strategies. Conclusion: PatternLab offers an easy and unified access to a variety of feature selection and normalization strategies, each having its own niche. Additionally, graphing tools are available to aid in the analysis of high throughput experimental data.

T. Lignocellulosic materials from municipal solid waste emerge as attractive resources for anaerobic digestion biorefinery. To increase the knowledge required for establishing efficient bioprocesses, dynamics of batch fermentation by the cellulolytic bacterium Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum were compared using three cellulosic materials, paper handkerchief, cotton discs and Whatman filter paper. Fermentation of paper handkerchief occurred the fastest and resulted in a specific metabolic profile: it resulted in the lowest acetate-to-lactate and acetate-to-ethanol ratios. By shotgun proteomic analyses of paper handkerchief and Whatman paper incubations, 151 proteins with significantly different levels were detected, including 20 of the 65 cellulosomal components, 8 non-cellulosomal CAZymes and 44 distinct extracytoplasmic proteins. Consistent with the specific metabolic profile observed, many enzymes from the central carbon catabolic pathways had higher levels in paper handkerchief incubations. Among the quantified CAZymes and cellulosomal components, 10 endoglucanases mainly from the GH9 families and 7 other cellulosomal subunits had lower levels in paper handkerchief incubations. An in-depth characterization of the materials used showed that the lower levels of endoglucanases in paper handkerchief incubations could hypothetically result from its lower crystallinity index (50%) and degree of polymerization (970). By contrast, the higher hemicellulose rate in paper handkerchief (13.87%) did not result in the enhanced expression of enzyme with xylanase as primary activity, including enzymes from the \"xyl-doc \" cluster. It suggests the absence, in this material, of molecular structures that specifically lead to xylanase induction. The integrated approach developed in this work shows that subtle differences among cellulosic materials regarding chemical and structural characteristics have significant effects on expressed bacterial functions, in particular the cellulolysis machinery, resulting in different metabolic patterns and degradation dynamics.","title":"Whole proteome analyses on Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum show a modulation of the cellulolysis machinery in response to cellulosic materials with subtle differences in chemical and structural properties","authors":[{"name":"Badalato N."},{"name":"Guillot A."},{"name":"Sabarly V."},{"name":"Dubois M."},{"name":"Pourette N."},{"name":"Pontoire B."},{"name":"Robert P."},{"name":"Bridier A."},{"name":"Monnet V."},{"name":"Sousa D.Z."},{"name":"Durand S."},{"name":"Mazeas L."},{"name":"Buleon A."},{"name":"Bouchez T."},{"name":"Mortha G."},{"name":"Bize A."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170524"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"},{"term":"Mascot .dat file","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3713"},{"term":"X!Tandem XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3711"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pappso","biotoolsID":"pappso","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:29:38Z","name":"PAPPSO","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:28Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A web application for storing, sharing, analyzing, and reusing targeted assays created and refined with Skyline,1 an increasingly popular Windows client software tool for targeted proteomics experiments.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":109,"date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"© 2014 American Chemical Society.Panorama is a web application for storing, sharing, analyzing, and reusing targeted assays created and refined with Skyline,1 an increasingly popular Windows client software tool for targeted proteomics experiments.

We have developed the PANDORA web server, which functions as a platform for the advanced biological analysis of sets of genes, proteins, or proteolytic peptides. First, the input set is mapped to a set of corresponding proteins. Then, an analysis of the protein set produces a graph-based hierarchy which highlights intrinsic relations amongst biological subsets, in light of their different annotations from multiple annotation resources. PANDORA integrates a large collection of annotation sources (GO, UniProt Keywords, InterPro, Enzyme, SCOP, CATH, Gene-3D, NCBI taxonomy and more) that comprise ~200 000 different annotation terms associated with ~3.2 million sequences from UniProtKB. Statistical enrichment based on a binomial approximation of the hypergeometric distribution and corrected for multiple hypothesis tests is calculated using several background sets, including major gene-expression DNA-chip platforms.

In addition, PA is currently the most accurate and most comprehensive system for predicting subcellular localization, the location within a cell where a protein performs its main function. Two other capabilities of PA are notable. First, PA can create a custom classifier to predict a new property, without requiring any programming, based on labeled training data (i.e. a set of examples, each with the correct classification label) provided by a user. PA has been used to create custom classifiers for potassium-ion channel proteins and other general function ontologies.

However, no in silico peptide fingerprinting software existed to facilitate such phylogeny inference. Hence, we developed the Peptidomes for Phylogenies (P4P) web tool, which enables the survey of similarities between microbial proteomes and simplifies the process of obtaining new biological insights into their phylogeny. P4P can be used to analyze different peptide datasets, i.e. bacteria, viruses, eukaryotic species or even metaproteomes. Also, it is able to work with whole proteome datasets and experimental mass-to-charge lists originated from mass spectrometers. The ultimate aim is to generate a valid and manageable list of peptides that have phylogenetic signal and are potentially sample-specific. Sample-to-sample comparison is based on a consensus peak set matrix, which can be further submitted to phylogenetic analysis. P4P holds great potential for improving phylogenetic analyses in challenging taxonomic groups, biomarker identification or epidemiologic studies. Notably, P4P can be of interest for applications handling large proteomic datasets, which it is able to reduce to small matrices while maintaining high phylogenetic resolution.

However, to our knowledge, none of them have been conceived to meet the particular needs generated by the study of organisms whose genomes are not sequenced. In that context, we have developed OVNIp, an open-source application which facilitates the whole process of proteomics results interpretation. One of its unique attributes is its capacity to compile multiple results (from several search engines and/or several databank searches) with a resolution of conflicting interpretations. Moreover, OVNIp enables automated exploitation of de novo sequences generated from unassigned MS/MS spectra leading to higher sequence coverage and enhancing confidence in the identified proteins. The exploitation of these additional spectra might also identify novel proteins through a MS-BLAST search, which can be easily ran from the OVNIp interface. Beyond this primary scope, OVNIp can also benefit to users who look for a simple standalone application to both visualize and confirm MS/MS result interpretations through a simple graphical interface and generate reports according to user-defined forms which may integrate the prerequisites for publication.

Our open source software OpenMZxy (http://www.bioprocess.org/openmzxy) enables automatic and manual sampling, as well as the recording of position data.For ionization we used a low-temperature plasma probe (LTP), coupled to a quadrupole mass analyzer. The current set-up has a practical resolution of 1. mm, and a sampling area of 100. ×. 100. mm, resulting in up to 10,000 sampling points. Our prototype is easy and economical to adopt for different types of mass analyzers.We prove the usability of the LTP-MSI system for macroscopic samples by imaging the distribution of metabolites in the longitudinal cross-cut of a chili (Capsicum annuum, 'Jalapeño pepper') fruit. The localization of capsaicin in the placenta could be confirmed. But additionally, yet unknown low molecular weight compounds were detected in defined areas, which underline the potential of LTP-MSI for the imaging of volatile and semi-volatile metabolites and for the discovery of new natural products.Biological significance.

Bioinformatics","abstract":"Background: Today, data evaluation has become a bottleneck in chromatographic science. Analytical instruments equipped with automated samplers yield large amounts of measurement data, which needs to be verified and analyzed. Since nearly every GC/MS instrument vendor offers its own data format and software tools, the consequences are problems with data exchange and a lack of comparability between the analytical results. To challenge this situation a number of either commercial or non-profit software applications have been developed. These applications provide functionalities to import and analyze several data formats but have shortcomings in terms of the transparency of the implemented analytical algorithms and/or are restricted to a specific computer platform.Results: This work describes a native approach to handle chromatographic data files. The approach can be extended in its functionality such as facilities to detect baselines, to detect, integrate and identify peaks and to compare mass spectra, as well as the ability to internationalize the application. Additionally, filters can be applied on the chromatographic data to enhance its quality, for example to remove background and noise. Extended operations like do, undo and redo are supported.Conclusions: OpenChrom is a software application to edit and analyze mass spectrometric chromatographic data. It is extensible in many different ways, depending on the demands of the users or the analytical procedures and algorithms. It offers a customizable graphical user interface.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: High-throughput reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) technology allows for the parallel measurement of protein expression levels in approximately 1000 samples. However, the many steps required in the complex protocol (sample lysate preparation, slide printing, hybridization, washing and amplified detection) may create substantial variability in data quality. We are not aware of any other quality control algorithm that is tuned to the special characteristics of RPPAs. Results: We have developed a novel classifier for quality control of RPPA experiments using a generalized linear model and logistic function. The outcome of the classifier, ranging from 0 to 1, is defined as the probability that a slide is of good quality. After training, we tested the classifier using two independent validation datasets. We conclude that the classifier can distinguish RPPA slides of good quality from those of poor quality sufficiently well such that normalization schemes, protein expression patterns and advanced biological analyses will not be drastically impacted by erroneous measurements or systematic variations.

In the absence of convincing tandem MS identifications, comparing peptide quantities between experiments (or fractions) requires the chromatographic alignment of MS signals. An extension of dynamic time warping (DTW), termed ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp), is presented and used to align a variety of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS) proteomics data sets. An algorithm to produce a bijective (one-to-one) function from DTW output is coupled with piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to produce a smooth warping function. Data sets were chosen to represent a broad selection of ESI-LC-MS alignment cases. High confidence, overlapping tandem mass spectra are used as standards to optimize and compare alignment parameters. We determine that Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of spectra similarity outperforms covariance, dot product, and Euclidean distance in its ability to produce correct alignments with optimal and suboptimal alignment parameters. We demonstrate the importance of penalizing gaps for best alignments. Using optimized parameters, we show that OBI-Warp produces alignments consistent with time standards across these data sets.

This study presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000 spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and incorporated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets, Novor sequenced 7%-37% more correct residues than the state-of-the-art de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude faster. Novor can de novo sequence more than 300 MS/MS spectra per second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed of today's mass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a new possibility to de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the spectral data.","title":"Novor: Real-Time Peptide de Novo Sequencing Software","authors":[{"name":"Ma B."}]},"pmid":"26122521","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation of peptide-spectrum matches","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3648"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"de Novo sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3644"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://www.rapidnovor.com/download/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:novor","biotoolsID":"novor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:28:27Z","name":"Novor","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:12Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://www.rapidnovor.com/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"R function for compound, adducts and ion series detection using isotopic distributions.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/nontarget_1.9.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":6,"date":"2017-02-23T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Cheminformatics","abstract":"© 2017 The Author(s). Background: A large proportion of polar anthropogenic compounds routinely released into the environment comprises homologue series, i.e., sets of chemicals differing in a repeating chemical unit. Using analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), these compounds are readily measurable as signal sets with characteristic differences in mass and typically retention time. However, and despite such distinct characteristics, no computational approach for the direct, simultaneous and untargeted detection of all such signal sets comprising both LC and HRMS information has to date been presented. Results: A fast two-staged approach has been developed to extract LC-HRMS signal patterns which can be indicative of homologous analytes. In a first stage, a k-d tree representation of picked LC-HRMS peaks is used to extract all feasible 3-tuples of peaks with restrictions in, e.g., mass defect differences. A second stage then recombines these 3-tuples to larger series tuples while ensuring smooth changes in their retention time characteristics. This unsupervised approach was evaluated for ten effluent samples from Swiss sewage treatment plants (STPs), in both positive and negative electrospray-ionization. Conclusions: Beside recovering all continuous series of previously identified homologues, substantial fractions of nontargeted peaks could subsequently be assigned into very diverse peak series, although assignments were often not unique. The latter ambiguities were resolved by a self-organizing map technique and revealed both distinctive series meshing and rivaling combinatorial solutions in the presence of isobaric or gapped series peaks. When comparing STPs, several ubiquitous yet partially low-frequent series mass differences emerged and may prioritize future identification efforts. The presented algorithm is freely available as part of the R package nontarget and as a user-friendly web-interface at www.envihomolog.eawag.ch. Graphical Abstract Search for systematic series indicative of homologous compounds is based on a partitioned representation of LC-HRMS signal characteristics. This nontargeted search first extracts series triplets in a nearest-neighbour walk and then recombines them to larger ones. For illustration, the two dimensions involving mass defect characteristics are represented by one only.","title":"Nontargeted homologue series extraction from hyphenated high resolution mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Loos M."},{"name":"Singer H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s13321-017-0197-z"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Martin Loos","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"Martin.Loos@eawag.ch","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nontarget/nontarget.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nontarget","biotoolsID":"nontarget","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:28:24Z","name":"nontarget","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:01Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nontarget/index.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A decoy-free approach to the identification of peptides.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":14,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"© 2015 American Chemical Society.

Recently, we developed NetAligner, a novel network alignment tool that allows the identification of conserved protein complexes and pathways across organisms, providing valuable hints as to how those interaction networks evolved.

The user can query complexes and pathways of arbitrary topology against a target species interactome, or directly compare two complete interactomes to identify conserved complexes and subnetworks.

Common examples include the use of relative quantification to identify differentially expressed peptides and proteins in cartilage and tendon. We are working on characterising so-called \u2018neopeptides\u2019, i.e. peptides formed due to native cleavage of proteins, for example under pathological conditions. Unlike peptides typically quantified in MS workflows due to the in vitro use of an enzyme such as trypsin, a neopeptide has at least one terminus that was not due to the use of trypsin in the workflow. The identification of neopeptides within these datasets is important in understanding disease pathology, and the development of antibodies that could be utilised as diagnostic biomarkers for diseases, such as osteoarthritis, and targets for novel treatments. Our previously described neopeptide data analysis workflow was laborious and was not amenable to robust statistical analysis, which reduced confidence in the neopeptides identified. To overcome this, we developed \u2018Neopeptide Analyser\u2019, a user friendly neopeptide analysis tool used in conjunction with label-free MS quantification tool Progenesis QIP for proteomics. Neopeptide Analyser filters data sourced from Progenesis QIP output to identify neopeptide sequences, as well as give the residues that are adjacent to the peptide in its corresponding protein sequence. It also produces normalised values for the neopeptide quantification values and uses these to perform statistical tests, which are also included in the output. Neopeptide Analyser is available as a Java application for Mac, Windows and Linux. The analysis features and ease of use encourages data exploration, which could aid the discovery of novel pathways in extracellular matrix degradation, the identification of potential biomarkers and as a tool to investigate matrix turnover.

We describe a method of comparing two two-dimensional (2-D) protein gels of similar samples created in different laboratories to help identify or suggest protein spot identification. Now that 2-D gels and associated databases frequently appear on the Internet, this opens up the possibility of visually comparing one's own experimental 2-D gel image data with data from another gel in a remote Internet database. In general, there are a few ways to compare images: (i) slide one gel (autoradiograph or stained gel) over the other while back-illuminated, or (ii) build a 2-D gel computer database from both gels after scanning and analyzing these gels. These are impractical since in the first case the gel from the Internet database is not locally available. In the second, the costs of building a multi-gel database solely to answer the question of whether a spot is the same spot may be excessive if only a single visual comparison is needed. We describe a distributed gel comparison program (URL: http://www-lmmb.ncifcrf.gov/flicker) which runs on any World Wide Web (WWW) connected computer and is invoked from a Java-capable web browser. One gel image is read from any Internet 2-D gel database (e.g. SWISS-2DPAGE) and the other may reside on the investigator's computer. Images may be more easily compared by first applying spatial warping or other transforms interactively on the user's computer. First, regions of interest are 'landmarked' with several corresponding points in each gel image, then one gel image is warped to the geometry of the other. As the two gels are rapidly alternated, or flickered, in the same window, the user can slide one gel past the other to visually align corresponding spots by matching local morphology. This flicker-comparison technique may be applied to analyzing other types of one-dimensional and 2-D biomedical images.","title":"Comparing two-dimensional electrophoretic gel images across the

and to easily integrate in automated environments. We present wiff2dta, a tool created to convert MS/MS data obtained using Applied Biosystem's QStar and QTrap 2000 and 4000 series. Results: Comparing the performance of wiff2dta with the standard tools, we find wiff2dta being the fastest solution for extracting spectrum data from ABIs raw file format. wiff2dta is at least 10% faster than the standard tools. It is also capable of batch processing and can be easily integrated in high throughput environments. The program is freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de, http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/ and is also available from Applied Biosystems. Conclusions: wiff2dta offers the possibility to run as stand-alone application or within a batch process as command-line tool integrated in automation and high-throughput environments.

However, flexible integration of these methods into configurations best suited to the research question is hampered by heterogeneous file formats and monolithic software development. The mzXML, mzData, and mzML file formats have enabled uniform access to unprocessed raw data. In this paper we present our efforts to produce an equally simple and powerful format, PeakML, to uniformly exchange processed intermediary and result data. To demonstrate the versatility of PeakML, we have developed an open source Java toolkit for processing, filtering, and annotating mass spectra in a customizable pipeline (mzMatch), as well as a user-friendly data visualization environment (PeakML Viewer). The PeakML format in particular enables the flexible exchange of processed data between software created by different groups or companies, as we illustrate by providing a PeakML-based integration of the widely used XCMS package with mzMatch data processing tools. As an added advantage, downstream analysis can benefit from direct access to the full mass trace information underlying summarized mass spectrometry results, providing the user with the means to rapidly verify results.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used and evolving technique for the high-throughput identification of molecules in biological samples. The need for sharing and reuse of code among bioinformaticians working with MS data prompted the design and implementation of MzJava, an open-source Java Application Programming Interface (API) for MS related data processing. MzJava provides data structures and algorithms for representing and processing mass spectra and their associated biological molecules, such as metabolites, glycans and peptides. MzJava includes functionality to perform mass calculation, peak processing (e.g. centroiding, filtering, transforming), spectrum alignment and clustering, protein digestion, fragmentation of peptides and glycans as well as scoring functions for spectrum-spectrum and peptide/glycan-spectrum matches. For data import and export MzJava implements readers and writers for commonly used data formats. For many classes support for the Hadoop MapReduce (hadoop.apache.org) and Apache Spark (spark.apache.org) frameworks for cluster computing was implemented. The library has been developed applying best practices of software engineering. To ensure that MzJava contains code that is correct and easy to use the library's API was carefully designed and thoroughly tested.

Many of these algorithms score potential identifications by evaluating the number of fragment ions matched between each peptide sequence and an observed spectrum. These systems, however, generally do not distinguish between matching an intense peak and matching a minor peak. We have developed a statistical model to score peptide matches that is based upon the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. This scorer, part of the \"MyriMatch\" database search engine, places greater emphasis on matching intense peaks. The probability that the best match for each spectrum has occurred by random chance can be employed to separate correct matches from random ones. We evaluated this software on data sets from three different laboratories employing three different ion trap instruments. Employing a novel system for testing discrimination, we demonstrate that stratifying peaks into multiple intensity classes improves the discrimination of scoring. We compare MyriMatch results to those of Sequest and X!Tandem, revealing that it is capable of higher discrimination than either of these algorithms. When minimal peak filtering is employed, performance plummets for a scoring model that does not stratify matched peaks by intensity. On the other hand, we find that MyriMatch discrimination improves as more peaks are retained in each spectrum. MyriMatch also scales well to tandem mass spectra from high-resolution mass analyzers. These findings may indicate limitations for existing database search scorers that count matched peaks without differentiating them by intensity.

Moreover, proteomics technologies and experimental methods are not yet standardized; hence a high degree of flexibility is necessary for efficient support of high- and low-throughput data analytic tasks. Development of a desktop environment that is sufficiently robust for deployment in data analytic pipelines, and simultaneously supports customization for programmers and non-programmers alike, has proven to be a significant challenge. Results: We describe multiplierz, a flexible and open-source desktop environment for comprehensive proteomics data analysis. We use this framework to expose a prototype version of our recently proposed common API (mzAPI) designed for direct access to proprietary mass spectrometry files. In addition to routine data analytic tasks, multiplierz supports generation of information rich, portable spreadsheet-based reports. Moreover, multiplierz is designed around a \"zero infrastructure\" philosophy, meaning that it can be deployed by end users with little or no system administration support. Finally, access to multiplierz functionality is provided via high-level Python scripts, resulting in a fully extensible data analytic environment for rapid development of custom algorithms and deployment of high-throughput data pipelines. Conclusion: Collectively, mzAPI and multiplierz facilitate a wide range of data analysis tasks, spanning technology development to biological annotation, for mass spectrometry-based proteomics research. © 2009 Parikh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Multiplierz: An extensible API based desktop environment for proteomics data analysis","authors":[{"name":"Parikh J.R."},{"name":"Askenazi M."},{"name":"Ficarro S.B."},{"name":"Cashorali T."},{"name":"Webber J.T."},{"name":"Blank N.C."},{"name":"Zhang Y."},{"name":"Marto J.A."}]},"pmid":"19874609","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-10-364"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":40,"date":"2009-04-13T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"","title":"mzAPI: A new strategy for efficiently sharing mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Askenazi M."},{"name":"Parikh J.R."},{"name":"Marto J.A."}]},"pmid":"19333238","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth0409-240"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":8,"date":"2011-05-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","abstract":"The growing use of mass spectrometry in the context of biomedical research has been accompanied by an increased demand for distribution of results in a format that facilitates rapid and efficient validation of claims by reviewers and other interested parties.

Moreover, the recently announced Philadelphia Guidelines (1, 2) suggest that authors provide native mass spectrometry data files in support of their peer-reviewed research articles. These trends highlight the need for data viewers and other tools that work independently of manufacturers' proprietary data systems and seamlessly connect proteomics results with original data files to support user-driven data validation and review. Based upon our recently described API1-based framework for mass spectrometry data analysis (3, 4), we created an interactive viewer (mzResults) that is built on established database standards and enables efficient distribution and interrogation of results associated with proteomics experiments, while also providing a convenient mechanism for authors to comply with data submission standards as described in the Philadelphia Guidelines. In addition, the architecture of mzResults supports in-depth queries of the native mass spectrometry files through our multiplierz software environment.

measurement in different cell states. To expedite the analysis of vast amounts of spectral data, we present a fully automated software package, called Multi-Q, for multiplexed iTRAQ-based quantitation in protein profiling. Multi-Q is designed as a generic platform that can accommodate various input data formats from search engines and mass spectrometer manufacturers. To calculate peptide ratios, the software automatically processes iTRAQ's signature peaks, including peak detection, background subtraction, isotope correction, and normalization to remove systematic errors. Furthermore, Multi-Q allows users to define their own data-filtering thresholds based on semiempirical values or statistical models so that the computed results of fold changes in peptide ratios are statistically significant. This feature facilitates the use of Multi-Q with various instrument types with different dynamic ranges, which is an important aspect of iTRAQ analysis. The performance of Multi-Q is evaluated with a mixture of 10 standard proteins and human Jurkat T cells. The results are consistent with expected protein ratios and thus demonstrate the high accuracy, full automation, and high-throughput capability of Multi-Q as a large-scale quantitation proteomics tool. These features allow rapid interpretation of output from large proteomic datasets without the need for manual validation.

Background: MTMDAT is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis. This approach can provide information about stable fragments of multidomain proteins, yield tertiary and quaternary structure data, and help determine the origin of stability changes at the amino acid residue level. Here, we introduce a pipeline between MTMDAT and HADDOCK, that facilitates protein-protein complex structure probing in a high-Throughput and highly automated fashion. Results: A new feature of MTMDAT allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis. If 3D structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex. We describe here a new implementation of MTMDAT, which includes a pipeline to the data-driven docking program HADDOCK, thus streamlining the entire procedure. This addition, together with usability improvements in MTMDAT, enables high-Throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. The algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component Rpn13 and ubiquitin. The resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by MTMDAT from limited proteolysis and modeled by HADDOCK, was compared to the published NMR structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular NOE interactions. The MTMDAT-HADDOCK structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by NMR titration experiments. Conclusions: The new MTMDAT-HADDOCK pipeline enables direct high-Throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data.

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) is a widely used approach for structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological samples. The importance of assessing the contribution of the precursor ion within an isolation window for MS2 experiments has been previously detailed in proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of matching to mass spectral libraries, but to date, there has been little attention to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. Here, we present msPurity, a vendor-independent R package for liquid chromatography (LC) and direct infusion (DI) MS2 that calculates a simple metric to describe the contribution of the selected precursor. The precursor purity metric is calculated as \"intensity of a selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window\". The metric is interpolated at the recorded point of MS2 acquisition using bordering full-scan spectra. Isotopic peaks of the selected precursor can be removed, and low abundance peaks that are believed to have limited contribution to the resulting MS2 spectra are removed. Additionally, the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be taken into account. The package was applied to Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA)-based MS2 metabolomics data sets derived from three metabolomics data repositories. For the 10 LC-MS2 DDA data sets with > ±1 Da isolation windows, the median precursor purity score ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 (scale = 0 to +1). The R package was also used to assess precursor purity of theoretical isolation windows from LC-MS data sets of differing sample types. The theoretical isolation windows being the same width used for an anticipated DDA experiment (±0.5 Da). The most complex sample had a median precursor purity score of 0.46 for the 64,498 XCMS determined features, in comparison to the less spectrally complex sample that had a purity score of 0.66 for 5071 XCMS features. It has been previously reported in proteomics that a purity score of <0.5 can produce unreliable spectra matching results. With this assumption, we show that for complex samples there will be a large number of metabolites where traditional DDA approaches will struggle to provide reliable annotations or accurate matches to mass spectral libraries.","title":"MsPurity: Automated Evaluation of Precursor Ion Purity for Mass Spectrometry-Based Fragmentation in Metabolomics","authors":[{"name":"Lawson T.N."},{"name":"Weber R.J.M."},{"name":"Jones M.R."},{"name":"Chetwynd A.J."},{"name":"Rodrlguez-Blanco G."},{"name":"Di Guida R."},{"name":"Viant M.R."},{"name":"Dunn W.B."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04358"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Thomas N.

Summary: Ongoing advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated accurate proteomic measurements and provide a wealth of information on genomic and transcript level. In proteogenomics, this multi-omics data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample-specific predictions. Existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six-frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, six-frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target database and SNP integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous experiments. We overcome these limitations by introducing MSProGene, a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized RNA-Seq driven transcript databases. MSProGene is independent from existing reference databases or annotated SNPs and avoids large six-frame translated databases by constructing sample-specific transcripts. In addition, it creates a network combining RNA-Seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum-flow algorithm. It thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference. We applied MSProGene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database-independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes.","title":"MSProGene: Integrative proteogenomics beyond six-frames and single nucleotide polymorphisms","authors":[{"name":"Zickmann F."},{"name":"Renard B.Y."}]},"pmid":"26072472","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Pathway or network prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Bernhard Y.

The null hypothesis H0, that a peptide matches a spectrum by chance, requires information on the probability of by-chance matches between peptide fragments and peaks in the spectrum. Likewise, the alternate hypothesis HA, that the spectrum is due to a particular peptide, requires probabilities that the peptide fragments would indeed be observed if it was the causative agent. We compare models for these probabilities by determining the identification rates produced by the models using an independent data set. The initial models use different probabilities depending on fragment ion type, but uniform probabilities for each ion type across all of the labile bonds along the backbone. More sophisticated models for probabilities under both HA and H0 are introduced that do not assume uniform probabilities for each ion type. In addition, the performance of these models using a standard likelihood model is compared to an information theory approach derived from the likelihood model. Also, a simple but effective model for incorporating peak intensities is described. Finally, a support-vector machine is used to discriminate between correct and incorrect identifications based on multiple characteristics of the scoring functions.

Capitalizing on the growing availability of large libraries of singlepeptide spectra (spectral libraries), our quantitative approach is able to identify up to 98% of all mixture spectra from equally abundant peptides and automatically adjust to varying abundance ratios of up to 10:1. Furthermore, we show how theoretical bounds on spectral similarity avoid the need to compare each experimental spectrum against all possible combinations of candidate peptides (achieving speedups of over five orders of magnitude) and demonstrate that mixture-spectra can be identified in a matter of seconds against proteome-scale spectral libraries.

Compound identification is done by comparison of the MS data with compound libraries. Mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics ought to connect the relevant mass traces of the metabolites to other relevant data, e.g. formulas, chemical structures, identification numbers to other databases etc. Since existing solutions are either commercial and therefore only available for certain instruments or not capable of storing such information, there is need to provide a software tool for the management of such data. Results: Here we present mSpecs, an open source software tool to manage mass spectral data in the field of metabolomics. It provides editing of mass spectra and virtually any associated information, automatic calculation of formulas and masses and is extensible by scripts. The graphical user interface is capable of common techniques such as copy/ paste, undo/redo and drag and drop. It owns import and export filters for the major public file formats in order to provide compatibility to commercial instruments. Conclusion: mSpecs is a versatile tool for the management and editing of mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics. Beyond that it provides capabilities for the automatic management of libraries though its scripting functionality. mSpecs can be used on all major platforms and is licensed under the GNU General Public License and available at http://mspecs.tu-bs.de. © 2009 Thielen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"mSpecs: A software tool for the administration and editing of mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics","authors":[{"name":"Thielen B."},{"name":"Heinen S."},{"name":"Schomburg D."}]},"pmid":"19624850","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dr. Dietmar Schomburg","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://bibc.tu-bs.de/bioinf/?site=team","email":"d.schomburg@tu-bs.de","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://mspecs.tu-bs.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=42"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mspecs_editor","biotoolsID":"mspecs_editor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:26:32Z","name":"mSpecs Editor","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T19:06:49Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://mspecs.tu-bs.de/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/dcgemperline/Morpheus_SpC"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/dcgemperline/Morpheus_SpC/issues"}],"description":"Morpheus Spectral Counter (MSpC) as the first computational tool that directly calculates Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) values from output obtained from Morpheus, a fast, open-source, peptide-MS/MS matching engine compatible with high-resolution accurate-mass instruments.","language":["C#"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":5,"date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we present Morpheus Spectral Counter (MSpC) as the first computational tool that directly calculates NSAF values from output obtained from Morpheus, a fast, open-source, peptide-MS/MS matching engine compatible with high-resolution accurate-mass instruments. NSAF has distinct advantages over other MS-based quantification methods, including a greater dynamic range as compared to isobaric tags, no requirement to align and re-extract MS1 peaks, and increased speed. MSpC features an easy-to-use graphic user interface that additionally calculates both distributed and unique NSAF values to permit analyses of both protein families and isoforms/proteoforms. MSpC determinations of protein concentration were linear over several orders of magnitude based on the analysis of several high-mass accuracy datasets either obtained from PRIDE or generated with total cell extracts spiked with purified Arabidopsis 20S proteasomes.

However, the technology is not mature and multiple research groups in both academia and industry are still very actively studying the fundamentals of imaging techniques, adapting the technology to new ionization sources, and developing new applications. As a result, there important varieties of data file formats used to store mass spectrometry imaging data and, concurrent to the development of MSi, collaborative efforts have been undertaken to introduce common imaging data file formats.

We introduce here MSiReader, a free open source application to read and analyze high resolution MSI data from the most common MSi data formats.

The possibility to localize or to follow changes in organisms at the molecular level by imaging component distributions of specific tissues, is of prime importance to unravel biochemical pathways and develop new treatments and drugs. Established molecular imaging techniques such as MRI and PET are already widely used, however their need for molecular probes to report the presence of the analytes of interest precludes the simultaneous exploration of different biomolecules. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI MSI) takes full advantage of the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry instrumentation but also of the ability of the latter to simultaneously detect a wide range of compounds, almost regardless from their nature and mass. To perform MALDI MSI, sections of biological tissues are introduced in an MALDI MS instrument, where the UV pulsed laser of the MALDI source is used to raster over a selected area while acquiring mass spectra of the ablated ions at every image point. From this array of spectra, hundreds of analyte-specific images can be generated based on the selected masses. MALDI MSI can be used to track biomarkers such as peptides or proteins but also to map drug/tissue interactions. In this paper, an overview of the possibilities of MSI will be given. As an example, MSI on brain tissue sections for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be shown. Mapping of amyloid peptides as a new approach for drug lead optimization will be presented. Target identification thanks to MSI will be introduced and the last part will be dedicated to the molecular scanner approach, which gives access to high-mass range by combining tissue blotting and digestion in a one-step process. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To allow a quick search for components in the mixtures, a special type of display has been developed that shows all the data obtained in an analysis run simultaneously. On the screen, the m/z information from the mass scan (in the x direction) and the time (as scan number, in the y direction) are displayed with mass peaks given as single points. The relative intensity of a signal is colour coded. Thus, it is easy to recognize analyte signals as bright islands in a dark surrounding; even weak signals in the vicinity of strong background ions are identified quite clearly. Additionally, the program incorporates some features to allow a simple operation and very fast investigation of the data.

Here we describe a simple solution to the specific problem of aligning one LC-MS dataset and one LC-MS/MS dataset, acquired on separate instruments from an enzymatic digest of a protein mixture, using feature extraction and a genetic algorithm. First, the LC-MS dataset is searched within a few ppm of the calculated theoretical masses of peptides confidently identified by LC-MS/MS. A piecewise linear function is then fitted to these matched peptides using a genetic algorithm with a fitness function that is insensitive to incorrect matches but sufficiently flexible to adapt to the discrete shifts common when comparing LC datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this method by aligning ion trap LC-MS/MS data with accurate LC-MS data from an FTICR mass spectrometer and show how hybrid datasets can improve peptide and protein identification by combining the speed of the ion trap with the mass accuracy of the FTICR, similar to using a hybrid ion trap-FTICR instrument. We also show that the high resolving power of FTICR can improve precision and linear dynamic range in quantitative proteomics.

While novel DDA approaches have been proposed, their evaluation is made difficult by the need of programmatic control of a mass spectrometer.

The chromatographic purification yielded a single protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis providing an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa and a broad peak (m/z 58 061) in linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) indicating the glycoprotein nature of the enzyme. Indeed, a colorimetric assessment with phenol and sulfuric acid showed the presence of neutral sugars (9% of weight). The subsequent treatment with N-glycosidase F released a variety of high-mannose type N-glycans,which were successfully detected using MALDI-TOF MS. MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS analysis of glycopeptides from a tryptic digest of prolyl endoprotease unraveled the identity of the N-glycosylation site in the primary structure. The data obtained also show that the enzyme is present in its processed form, i.e. without putative signal and propeptide parts. Spectrophotometric measurements demonstrated optimal activity at pH 4.0-4.5 and also high thermostability for the cleavage at the C-terminal part of proline residues. In-solution digestion of standard proteins (12-200 kDa) allowed to evaluate the cleavage specificity. The enzyme acts upon proline and alanine residues, but there is an additional minor cleavage at some other residues like Gly, Leu, Arg, Ser and Tyr. The digestion of a honeybee peptide comprising six proline residues (apidaecin 1A) led to the detection of specific peptides terminated by proline as it was confirmed by MALDI postsource decay analysis.

Traditional MS/MS database search algorithms such as SEQUEST and Mascot were originally designed for collision induced dissociation (CID) of tryptic peptides and are largely based on expert knowledge about fragmentation of tryptic peptides (rather than machine learning techniques) to design CID-specific scoring functions. As a result, the performance of these algorithms is suboptimal for new mass spectrometry technologies or nontryptic peptides. We recently proposed the generating function approach (MS-GF) for CID spectra of tryptic peptides. In this study, we extend MS-GF to automatically derive scoring parameters from a set of annotated MS/MS spectra of any type (e.g. CID, ETD, etc.), and present a new database search tool MS-GFDB based on MS-GF. We show that MS-GFDB outperforms Mascot for ETD spectra or peptides digested with Lys-N. For example, in the case of ETD spectra, the number of tryptic and Lys-N peptides identified by MS-GFDB increased by a factor of 2.7 and 2.6 as compared with Mascot. Moreover, even following a decade of Mascot developments for analyzing CID spectra of tryptic peptides, MS-GFDB (that is not particularly tailored for CID spectra or tryptic peptides) resulted in 28% increase over Mascot in the number of peptide identifications. Finally, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing multiple spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs) and assigning p values to peptide-spectrum-spectrum matches. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","title":"The generating function of CID, ETD, and CID/ETD pairs of tandem mass spectra: Applications to database search","authors":[{"name":"Kim S."},{"name":"Mischerikow N."},{"name":"Bandeira N."},{"name":"Navarro J.D."},{"name":"Wich L."},{"name":"Mohammed S."},{"name":"Heck A.J.R."},{"name":"Pevzner P.A."}]},"pmid":"20829449","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]},{"data":{"term":"P-value","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1669"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3483"},"format":[{"term":"pkl","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3653"},{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"},{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"dta","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3652"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]},{"data":{"term":"Sequence set (protein)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1233"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"},{"term":"Blind peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3647"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"},{"term":"Tag-based peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3643"},{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"},{"term":"Target-Decoy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3649"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/MSGFPlus/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ms-gfdb","biotoolsID":"ms-gfdb","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:25:27Z","name":"MS-GFDB","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:21Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"A tool which performs peptide identification by scoring MS/MS spectra against peptides derived from a protein sequence database.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/sangtaekim/msgfplus"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":270,"date":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Communications","abstract":"© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of \"one-hit-wonders\" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in MS/MS searches. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","title":"Spectral

Because tandem mass spectra of intact proteins are very complex, spectral deconvolution (grouping peaks into isotopomer envelopes) is a key initial stage for their interpretation. In such spectra, isotopomer envelopes of different protein fragments span overlapping regions on the m/z axis and even share spectral peaks. This raises both pattern recognition and combinatorial challenges for spectral deconvolution. We present MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm for spectral deconvolution. The algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer envelopes for a spectrum, then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally selects its highest scoring subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the graph. In contrast with other approaches, the algorithm scores sets of envelopes rather than individual envelopes. We demonstrate that MS-Deconv improves on Thrash and Xtract in the number of correctly recovered monoisotopic masses and speed. We applied MS-Deconv to a large set of top-down spectra from Yersinia rohdei (with a still unsequenced genome) and further matched them against the protein database of related and sequenced bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica.

To describe peptide and associated transitions as stable, quantifiable, and reproducible representatives of proteins of interest, experimental and analytical validation is required. However, inadequate and disparate analytical tools and validation methods predispose assay performance measures to errors and inconsistencies. Results: Implemented as a freely available, open-source tool in the platform independent Java programing language, MRMPlus computes analytical measures as recommended recently by the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium Assay Development Working Group for \"Tier 2\" assays - that is, non-clinical assays sufficient enough to measure changes due to both biological and experimental perturbations. Computed measures include; limit of detection, lower limit of quantification, linearity, carry-over, partial validation of specificity, and upper limit of quantification. Conclusions: MRMPlus streamlines assay development analytical workflow and therefore minimizes error predisposition.

When analyzing huge shotgun proteomics datasets with Mascot™'s native tools, limits of computing resources are easily reached. Up to now no application has been available as open source that is capable of converting the full content of Mascot™ result files from the original MIME format into a database-compatible tabular format, allowing direct import into database management systems and efficient handling of huge datasets analyzed by Mascot™. Results: A program called mres2x is presented, which reads Mascot™ result files, analyzes them and extracts either selected or all information in order to store it in a single file or multiple files in formats which are easier to handle downstream of Mascot™. It generates different output formats. The output of mres2x in tab format is especially designed for direct high-performance import into relational database management systems using native tools of these systems. Having the data available in database management systems allows complex queries and extensive analysis. In addition, the original peak lists can be extracted in DTA format suitable for protein identification using the Sequest™ program, and the Mascot™ files can be split, preserving the original data format. During conversion, several consistency checks are performed. mres2x is designed to provide high throughput processing combined with the possibility to be driven by other computer programs. The source code including supplement material and precompiled binaries is available via http://www.protein-ms.de and http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/.

Experimental results demonstrate that, relative to the serial version, MR-MSPolygraph reduces the time to solution from weeks to hours, for processing tens of thousands of experimental spectra.

The hybrid search method increased the number of spectra that can be assigned to a peptide in a global proteomics study by 57-147% at an estimated false discovery rate of 5%, with clear room for even greater improvements. The approach combines the general utility of using consensus model spectra typical of database search methods with the accuracy of the intensity information contained in spectral libraries. A common scoring metric based on recent developments linking data analysis and statistical thermodynamics is used, which allows the use of a conservative estimate of error rates for the combined data. We applied this approach to proteomics analysis of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a cyanobacterium that is a model organism for studies of photosynthetic carbon fixation and biofuels development.

Metaproteomics, the mass spectrometry-based analysis of proteins from multispecies samples faces severe challenges concerning data analysis and results interpretation. To overcome these shortcomings, we here introduce the MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA) Portable software. In contrast to the original server-based MPA application, this newly developed tool no longer requires computational expertise for installation and is now independent of any relational database system. In addition, MPA Portable now supports state-of-the-art database search engines and a convenient command line interface for high-performance data processing tasks. While search engine results can easily be combined to increase the protein identification yield, an additional two-step workflow is implemented to provide sufficient analysis resolution for further postprocessing steps, such as protein grouping as well as taxonomic and functional annotation. Our new application has been developed with a focus on intuitive usability, adherence to data standards, and adaptation to Web-based workflow platforms.

Here we present a new generation of mMass, a cross-platform environment for the precise analysis of individual mass spectra. The software covers a wide range of processing tasks such as import from various data formats, smoothing, baseline correction, peak picking, deisotoping, charge determination, and recalibration. Functions presented in the earlier versions such as in silico digestion and fragmentation were redesigned and improved. In addition to Mascot, an interface for ProFound has been implemented. A specific tool is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation. The largest available lipid database (from the LIPID MAPS Consortium) has been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of mMass is based on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality for data processing and interpretation.

and Cellular Proteomics","abstract":"© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. In large-scale proteomic experiments, multiple peptide precursors are often cofragmented simultaneously in the same mixture tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrum. These spectra tend to elude current computational tools because of the ubiquitous assumption that each spectrum is generated from only one peptide. Therefore, tools that consider multiple peptide matches to each MS/MS spectrum can potentially improve the relatively low spectrum identification rate often observed in proteomics experiments. More importantly, data independent acquisition protocols promoting the cofragmentation of multiple precursors are emerging as alternative methods that can greatly improve the throughput of peptide identifications but their success also depends on the availability of algorithms to identify multiple peptides from each MS/MS spectrum. Here we address a fundamental question in the identification of mixture MS/MS spectra: determining the statistical significance of multiple peptides matched to a given MS/MS spectrum. We propose the MixGF generating function model to rigorously compute the statistical significance of peptide identifications for mixture spectra and show that this approach improves the sensitivity of current mixture spectra database search tools by a ≈30-390%. Analysis of multiple data sets with MixGF reveals that in complex biological samples the number of identified mixture spectra can be as high as 20% of all the identified spectra and the number of unique peptides identified only in mixture spectra can be up to 35.4% of those identified in single-peptide spectra.","title":"MixGF: Spectral probabilities for mixture spectra from more than one peptide","authors":[{"name":"Wang J."},{"name":"Bourne P.E."},{"name":"Bandeira N."}]},"pmid":"25225354","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/","email":"jiw006@ucsd.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/MixGF/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mixgf","biotoolsID":"mixgf","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:24:27Z","name":"MixGF","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:51:36Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software-tools/mixgf/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mixdb-20111206-identify-mixture-msms-spectra-peptide.html"}],"description":"MixDB is a database search tool that able to identify mixture MS/MS spectra from more than one peptide.","language":["Java","Perl"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":21,"date":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","abstract":"In high-throughput proteomics the development of computational methods and novel experimental strategies often rely on each other. In certain areas, mass spectrometry methods for data acquisition are ahead of computational methods to interpret the resulting tandem mass spectra. Particularly, although there are numerous situations in which a mixture tandem mass spectrum can contain fragment ions from two or more peptides, nearly all database search tools still make the assumption that each tandem mass spectrum comes from one peptide. Common examples include mixture spectra from co-eluting peptides in complex samples, spectra generated from data-independent acquisition methods, and spectra from peptides with complex post-translational modifications. We propose a new database search tool (MixDB) that is able to identify mixture tandem mass spectra from more than one peptide. We show that peptides can be reliably identified with up to 95% accuracy from mixture spectra while considering only a 0.01% of all possible peptide pairs (four orders of magnitude speedup).

When combined with protein isotopic labeling, quantitative comparison of the proteome from different samples can be achieved using these approaches. However, bioinformatics analysis of the data remains a bottleneck in large scale quantitative proteomics studies. Here we present a new software named Mascot File Parsing and Quantification (MFPaQ) that easily processes the results of the Mascot search engine and performs protein quantification in the case of isotopic labeling experiments using either the ICAT or SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) method. This new tool provides a convenient interface to retrieve Mascot protein lists; sort them according to Mascot scoring or to user-defined criteria based on the number, the score, and the rank of identified peptides; and to validate the results. Moreover the software extracts quantitative data from raw files obtained by nano-LC-MS/MS, calculates peptide ratios, and generates a non-redundant list of proteins identified in a multisearch experiment with their calculated averaged and normalized ratio. Here we apply this software to the proteornics analysis of membrane proteins from primary human endothelial cells (ECs), a cell type involved in many physiological and pathological processes including chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. We analyzed the EC membrane proteome and set up methods for quantitative analysis of this proteome by ICAT labeling. EC microsomal proteins were fractionated and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS, and database searches were performed with Mascot. Data validation and clustering of proteins were performed with MFPaQ, which allowed identification of more than 600 unique proteins. The software was also successfully used in a quantitative differential proteomics analysis of the EC membrane proteome after stimulation with a combination of proinflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and lymphotoxin α/β) that resulted in the identification of a full spectrum of EC membrane proteins regulated by inflammation. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc.","title":"Mascot file parsing and quantification (MFPaQ), a new software to parse, validate, and quantify proteomics data generated by ICAT and SILAC mass spectrometric analyses: Application to the proteomics study of membrane proteins from primary human endothelial cells","authors":[{"name":"Bouyssie D."},{"name":"Gonzalez de Peredo A."},{"name":"Mouton E."},{"name":"Albigot R."},{"name":"Roussel L."},{"name":"Ortega N."},{"name":"Cayrol C."},{"name":"Burlet-Schiltz O."},{"name":"Girard J.-P."},{"name":"Monsarrat B."}]},"pmid":"17533220","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"Mascot .dat file","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3713"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation of peptide-spectrum matches","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3648"},{"term":"Differential protein expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3741"}]},{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"Mascot .dat file","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3713"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"WIFF format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3710"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"},{"term":"SILAC","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3638"},{"term":"Label-free quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3634"},{"term":"Labeled quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3635"},{"term":"Protein quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"}]},{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"HTML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2331"},{"term":"xls","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3468"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0945"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://mfpaq.sourceforge.net/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mfpaq","biotoolsID":"mfpaq","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:24:12Z","name":"MFPaQ","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:35Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://mfpaq.sourceforge.net"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Pipeline to analyze metaproteomics data, supporting MGF and X!Tandem, OMSSA and Mascot.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://code.google.com/p/meta-proteome-analyzer/source/checkout"},{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://code.google.com/p/meta-proteome-alyzer/source/checkout"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":47,"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"© 2015 American Chemical Society.The enormous challenges of mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics are primarily related to the analysis and interpretation of the acquired data.

The analysis of such extensive systems results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which specific analysis tools are required to speed up data validation and interpretation. Results: We introduce a web application and a new R-package named 'MEMHDX' to help users analyze, validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is composed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the validation of the results by applying a mixed-effects model for each peptide, in each experimental condition, and at each time point, taking into account the time dependency of the HDX reaction and number of independent replicates. Two adjusted P-values are generated per peptide, one for the 'Change in dynamics' and one for the 'Magnitude of ΔD', and are used to classify the data by means of a 'Logit' representation. A user-friendly interface developed with Shiny by RStudio facilitates the use of the package.

However, most of the existing membrane-protein predictors have the following problems: (1) they do not predict whether a given protein is a membrane protein or not, (2) they are limited to predicting membrane proteins with single-label functional types but ignore those with multi-functional types; and (3) there is still much room for improvement for their performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes a two-layer multi-label predictor, namely Mem-ADSVM, which can identify membrane proteins (Layer I) and their multi-functional types (Layer II). Specifically, given a query protein, its associated gene ontology (GO) information is retrieved by searching a compact GO-term database with its homologous accession number. Subsequently, the GO information is classified by a binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether it is a membrane protein or not. If yes, it will be further classified by a multi-label multi-class SVM classifier equipped with an adaptive-decision (AD) scheme to determine to which functional type(s) it belongs. Experimental results show that Mem-ADSVM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art predictors in terms of identifying both membrane proteins and their multi-functional types. This paper also suggests that the two-layer prediction architecture is better than the one-layer for prediction performance.

Initial mapping efforts have already produced a wealth of data. As the size of the interaction set increases, databases and computational methods will be required to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively aid in knowledge discovery. Results: This paper describes a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm, \"Molecular Complex Detectio\" (MCODE), that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph clustering methods of having a directed mode that allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation. Conclusion: Dense regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives in data from high-throughput interaction techniques. © 2003 Bader and Hogue; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"An automated method for finding molecular complexes in large protein interaction networks","authors":[{"name":"Bader G.D."},{"name":"Hogue C.W.V."}]},"pmid":"12525261","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein interaction network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0276"},{"term":"Pathway or network visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"},{"term":"Protein interaction network comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0277"},{"term":"Protein interaction prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"},{"term":"Pathway or network prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Gary Bader","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://baderlab.org/GaryBader","email":"gary.bader@utoronto.ca","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://baderlab.org/Software/MCODE"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://baderlab.org/Software/MCODE/UsersManual"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mcode","biotoolsID":"mcode","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:23:37Z","name":"MCODE","topic":[{"term":"Protein interactions","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0128"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Protein interaction experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3557"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"}],"additionDate":"2017-05-02T07:18:25Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://baderlab.org/Software/MCODE"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Estimates protein identification false discovery rates.","language":["R","Perl"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/proteomics-mayu/mayu"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":190,"date":"2009-12-22T00:00:00Z","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","abstract":"Comprehensive characterization of a proteome is a fundamental goal in proteomics. To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches. We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance any study relying on these data sources.

In particular, there is still a lack of fast and robust data processing tools for targeted (relative) quantitation. We have developed modular, high-throughput data processing software, MassyTools, that is capable of calibrating spectra, extracting data, and performing quality control calculations based on a user-defined list of glycan or glycopeptide compositions. Typical examples of output include relative areas after background subtraction, isotopic pattern-based quality scores, spectral quality scores, and signal-to-noise ratios. We demonstrated MassyTools' performance on MALDI-TOF-MS glycan and glycopeptide data from different samples. MassyTools yielded better calibration than the commercial software flexAnalysis, generally showing 2-fold better ppm errors after internal calibration. Relative quantitation using MassyTools and flexAnalysis gave similar results, yielding a relative standard deviation (RSD) of the main glycan of ∼6%. However, MassyTools yielded 2- to 5-fold lower RSD values for low-abundant analytes than flexAnalysis. Additionally, feature curation based on the computed quality criteria improved the data quality. In conclusion, we show that MassyTools is a robust automated data processing tool for high-throughput, high-performance glycosylation analysis.

Several data processing and data evaluation steps are required to come to the final results. These operations are often difficult to reproduce, because of too specific computing platforms. This effect, known as 'workflow decay', can be diminished by using a standardized informatic infrastructure. Thus, we compiled an integrated platform, which contains ready-to-use tools and workflows for mass spectrometry data analysis. Apart from general unit operations, such as peak picking and identification of proteins and metabolites, we put a strong emphasis on the statistical validation of results and Data Mining. MASSyPup64 includes e.g., the OpenMS/TOPPAS framework, the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline programs, the ProteoWizard tools, X!Tandem, Comet and SpiderMass. The statistical computing language R is installed with packages for MS data analyses, such as XCMS/metaXCMS andMetabR. The R package Rattle provides a user-friendly access to multiple Data Mining methods. Further, we added the non-conventional spreadsheet program teapot for editing large data sets and a command line tool for transposing large matrices. Individual programs, console commands and modules can be integrated using the Workflow Management System (WMS) taverna. We explain the useful combination of the tools by practical examples: (1) A workflow for protein identification and validation, with subsequent Association Analysis of peptides, (2) Cluster analysis and Data Mining in targeted Metabolomics, and (3) Raw data processing, Data Mining and identification of metabolites in untargeted Metabolomics. Association Analyses reveal relationships between variables across different sample sets. We present its application for finding co-occurring peptides, which can be used for target proteomics, the discovery of alternative biomarkers and protein-protein interactions. DataMining derived models displayed a higher robustness and accuracy for classifying sample groups in targeted Metabolomics than cluster analyses. Random Forest models do not only provide predictive models, which can be deployed for new data sets, but also the variable importance. We demonstrate that the later is especially useful for tracking down significant signals and affected pathways in untargeted Metabolomics. Thus, Random Forest modeling supports the unbiased search for relevant biological features inMetabolomics. Our results clearly manifest the importance of Data Mining methods to disclose non-obvious information in biological mass spectrometry . The application of aWorkflowManagement System and the integration of all required programs and data in a consistent platformmakes the presented data analyses strategies reproducible for non-expert users. The simple remastering process and the Open Source licenses of MASSyPup64 (http://www. bioprocess.org/massypup/) enable the continuous improvement of the system.","title":"An evolving computational platformfor biological mass spectrometry: Workflows, statistics and data mining with MASSyPup64","authors":[{"name":"Winkler R."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.7717/peerj.1401"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Robert Winkler","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"robert.winkler@ira.cinvestav.mx","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.lababi.bioprocess.org/index.php/14-sample-data-articles/78-massypup"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Suite"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:massypup","biotoolsID":"massypup","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:23:12Z","name":"MASSyPup","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:24Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.bioprocess.org/massypup"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Converts MassLynx format to mzXML.","language":["C++"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/sashimi/files/massWolf%20%28MassLynx%20converter%29/|https://sourceforge.net/p/sashimi/code/HEAD/tree/branches/4-8/trans_proteomic_pipeline/src/mzXML/converters/"}],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:massWolf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:masswolf","biotoolsID":"masswolf","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:23:08Z","name":"MassWolf","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:49Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/MassWolf.php"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Peptide identification and FDR calculation.","language":["Perl"],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":30,"date":"2011-05-06T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Mass spectrometry has made rapid advances in the recent past and has become the preferred method for proteomics. Although many open source algorithms for peptide identification exist, such as X!Tandem and OMSSA, it has majorly been a domain of proprietary software. There is a need for better, freely available, and configurable algorithms that can help in identifying the correct peptides while keeping the false positives to a minimum. We have developed MassWiz, a novel empirical scoring function that gives appropriate weights to major ions, continuity of b-y ions, intensities, and the supporting neutral losses based on the instrument type. We tested MassWiz accuracy on 486,882 spectra from a standard mixture of 18 proteins generated on 6 different instruments downloaded from the Seattle Proteome Center public repository. We compared the MassWiz algorithm with Mascot, Sequest, OMSSA, and X!Tandem at 1% FDR. MassWiz outperformed all in the largest data set (AGILENT XCT) and was second only to Mascot in the other data sets. MassWiz showed good performance in the analysis of high confidence peptides, i.e., those identified by at least three algorithms. We also analyzed a yeast data set containing 106,133 spectra downloaded from the NCBI Peptidome repository and got similar results. The results demonstrate that MassWiz is an effective algorithm for high-confidence peptide identification without compromising on the number of assignments.

The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods. Results: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, 'true' peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a 'goodness of fit' coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the 2D CWT coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with SELDI-TOF spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the CWT-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low. © 2006 Oxford University Press.","title":"Improved peak detection in mass spectrum by incorporating continuous wavelet transform-based pattern matching","authors":[{"name":"Du P."},{"name":"Kibbe W.A."},{"name":"Lin S.M."}]},"pmid":"16820428","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btl355"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Pan Du","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"dupan.mail@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MassSpecWavelet.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.40.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:massspecwavelet","biotoolsID":"massspecwavelet","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:23:00Z","name":"MassSpecWavelet","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:04:46Z","collectionID":["Proteomics","BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MassSpecWavelet.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/massshiftfinder-1-09-blind-search-post-translational-modifications-amino-acid-substitutions.html"}],"description":"Software tool for doing blind search using peptide mass fingerprints from two proteases with different cleavage specificities.

many software tools have been developed to perform quantification in LC-MS analyses. However, most of them are specific to either a quantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a mass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution). In this context, we have developed MassChroQ (Mass Chromatogram Quantification), a versatile software that performs LC-MS data alignment and peptide quantification by peak area integration on extracted ion chromatograms. MassChroQ is suitable for quantification with or without labelling and is not limited to high-resolution systems. Peptides of interest (for example all the identified peptides) can be determined automatically, or manually by providing targeted m/z and retention time values. It can handle large experiments that include protein or peptide fractionation (as SDS-PAGE, 2-D LC). It is fully configurable. Every processing step is traceable, the produced data are in open standard formats and its modularity allows easy integration into proteomic pipelines. The output results are ready for use in statistical analyses. Evaluation of MassChroQ on complex label-free data obtained from low and high-resolution mass spectrometers showed low CVs for technical reproducibility (1.4%) and high coefficients of correlation to protein quantity (0.98).

Detection efficiency varies significantly from peptide to peptide, molecular identities are not evident a priori, and peptides are dispersed unevenly throughout the multidimensional data space. To overcome these challenges we developed an open-source software package, MapQuant, to quantify comprehensively organic species detected in large MS datasets. MapQuant treats an LC/MS experiment as an image and utilizes standard image processing techniques to perform noise filtering, watershed segmentation, peak finding, peak fitting, peak clustering, charge-state determination and carbon-content estimation. MapQuant reports abundance values that respond linearly with the amount of sample analyzed on both low- and high-resolution instruments (over a 1000-fold dynamic range). Background noise added to a sample, either as a medium-complexity peptide mixture or as a high-complexity trypsinized proteome, exerts negligible effects on the abundance values reported by MapQuant and with coefficients of variance comparable to other methods. Finally, MapQuant's ability to define accurate mass and retention time features of isotopic clusters on a high-resolution mass spectrometer can increase protein sequence coverage by assigning sequence identities to observed isotopic clusters without corresponding MS/MS data. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry is an emerging technique that offers more complete detection and quantification of peptides and proteins across multiple samples. DIA allows fragment-level quantification, which can be considered as repeated measurements of the abundance of the corresponding peptides and proteins in the downstream statistical analysis. However, few statistical approaches are available for aggregating these complex fragment-level data into peptide- or protein-level statistical summaries. In this work, we describe a software package, mapDIA, for statistical analysis of differential protein expression using DIA fragment-level intensities. The workflow consists of three major steps: intensity normalization, peptide/fragment selection, and statistical analysis. First, mapDIA offers normalization of fragment-level intensities by total intensity sums as well as a novel alternative normalization by local intensity sums in retention time space. Second, mapDIA removes outlier observations and selects peptides/fragments that preserve the major quantitative patterns across all samples for each protein. Last, using the selected fragments and peptides, mapDIA performs model-based statistical significance analysis of protein-level differential expression between specified groups of samples. Using a comprehensive set of simulation datasets, we show that mapDIA detects differentially expressed proteins with accurate control of the false discovery rates.

Glycosylation is a highly complex modification influencing the functions and activities of proteins. Interpretation of intact glycopeptide spectra is crucial but challenging. In this paper, we present a mass spectrometry-based automated glycopeptide identification platform (MAGIC) to identify peptide sequences and glycan compositions directly from intact N-linked glycopeptide collision-induced-dissociation spectra. The identification of the Y1 (peptideY0 + GlcNAc) ion is critical for the correct analysis of unknown glycoproteins, especially without prior knowledge of the proteins and glycans present in the sample. To ensure accurate Y1-ion assignment, we propose a novel algorithm called Trident that detects a triplet pattern corresponding to [Y0, Y1, Y2] or [Y0-NH<inf>3<\/inf>, Y0, Y1] from the fragmentation of the common trimannosyl core of N-linked glycopeptides. To facilitate the subsequent peptide sequence identification by common database search engines, MAGIC generates in silico spectra by overwriting the original precursor with the naked peptide m/z and removing all of the glycan-related ions. Finally, MAGIC computes the glycan compositions and ranks them. For the model glycoprotein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a 5-glycoprotein mixture, a 2- to 31-fold increase in the relative intensities of the peptide fragments was achieved, which led to the identification of 7 tryptic glycopeptides from HRP and 16 glycopeptides from the mixture via Mascot. In the HeLa cell proteome data set, MAGIC processed over a thousand MS<sup>2<\/sup> spectra in 3 min on a PC and reported 36 glycopeptides from 26 glycoproteins. Finally, a remarkable false discovery rate of 0 was achieved on the N-glycosylation-free Escherichia coli data set.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Large multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), consisting of thousands of sequences, are becoming more and more common, due to advances in sequencing technologies. The MAFFT MSA program has several options for building large MSAs, but their performances have not been sufficiently assessed yet, because realistic benchmarking of large MSAs has been difficult. Recently, such assessments have been made possible through the HomFam and ContTest benchmark protein datasets. Along with the development of these datasets, an interesting theory was proposed: chained guide trees increase the accuracy of MSAs of structurally conserved regions. This theory challenges the basis of progressive alignment methods and needs to be examined by being compared with other known methods including computationally intensive ones. Results: We used HomFam, ContTest and OXFam (an extended version of OXBench) to evaluate several methods enabled in MAFFT: (1) a progressive method with approximate guide trees, (2) a progressive method with chained guide trees, (3) a combination of an iterative refinement method and a progressive method and (4) a less approximate progressive method that uses a rigorous guide tree and consistency score. Other programs, Clustal Omega and UPP, available for large MSAs, were also included into the comparison. The effect of method 2 (chained guide trees) was positive in ContTest but negative in HomFam and OXFam. Methods 3 and 4 increased the benchmark scores more consistently than method 2 for the three datasets, suggesting that they are safer to use.","title":"Application of the MAFFT sequence alignment program to large data - Reexamination of the usefulness of chained guide trees","authors":[{"name":"Yamada K.D."},{"name":"Tomii K."},{"name":"Katoh K."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw412"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0863"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0863"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Multiple sequence alignment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Project","name":"BioCatalogue","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.biocatalogue.org","email":null,"typeRole":["Documentor"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/mailform.html","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"BioCatalogue","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/msa/mafft_rest","type":["General"],"url":"http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mafft_ebi","biotoolsID":"mafft_ebi","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:22:02Z","name":"MAFFT (EBI)","topic":[{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"}],"additionDate":"2015-08-03T09:37:03Z","collectionID":["MAFFT","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/m2lite-20150127-proteome-discoverer-msf-to-mzidentml-tool.html"}],"description":"Lightweight, easily pluggable, and extremely fast conversion software tool.

For example, mass spectrometry driven proteomics experiments are frequently performed with few biological or technical replicates due to sample-scarcity or due to duty-cycle or sensitivity constraints, or limited capacity of the available instrumentation, leading to incomplete results where detection of significant feature changes becomes a challenge. This problem is further exacerbated for the detection of significant changes on the peptide level, for example, in phospho-proteomics experiments. In order to assess the extent of this problem and the implications for large-scale proteome analysis, we investigated and optimized the performance of three statistical approaches by using simulated and experimental data sets with varying numbers of missing values. We applied three tools, including standard t test, moderated t test, also known as limma, and rank products for the detection of significantly changing features in simulated and experimental proteomics data sets with missing values. The rank product method was improved to work with data sets containing missing values. Extensive analysis of simulated and experimental data sets revealed that the performance of the statistical analysis tools depended on simple properties of the data sets. High-confidence results were obtained by using the limma and rank products methods for analyses of triplicate data sets that exhibited more than 1000 features and more than 50% missing values. The maximum number of differentially represented features was identified by using limma and rank products methods in a complementary manner. We therefore recommend combined usage of these methods as a novel and optimal way to detect significantly changing features in these data sets. This approach is suitable for large quantitative data sets from stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry experiments and should be applicable to large data sets of any type. An R script that implements the improved rank products algorithm and the combined analysis is available. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","title":"Assessment and improvement of statistical tools for comparative proteomics analysis of sparse data sets with few experimental replicates","authors":[{"name":"Schwammle V."},{"name":"Leon I.R."},{"name":"Jensen O.N."}]},"pmid":"23875961","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/pr400045u"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"P-value","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1669"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"},{"term":"PDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3508"}]}],"note":"Differential expression analysis","input":[{"data":{"term":"Gene expression data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2603"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Matrix","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2082"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"},{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"bmb.sdu.dk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9708-6722","typeEntity":null,"name":"Veit Schwämmle","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk","email":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9708-6722","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Veit Schwämmle","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk","email":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Apps/LimmaRP/"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:limmarp","biotoolsID":"limmarp","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:21:28Z","name":"LimmaRP","topic":[{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Data visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Transcriptomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308"}],"additionDate":"2016-10-03T11:01:15Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Apps/LimmaRP/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Analyzes 4- and 8-channel iTRAQ data.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":428,"date":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"The Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) is a suite of software tools for the analysis of MS/MS data sets.

Although the incorporation of 18O in the C-terminal carboxyl group during endoproteinase digestion in the presence of H218O makes the process of labeling facile, the ease and effectiveness of label incorporation have in some regards been outweighed by the difficulties in interpreting the resulting spectra. Complex isotope patterns result from the composition of unlabeled (18O0), singly labeled (18O1), and doubly labeled species (18)2) as well as contributions from the naturally occurring isotopes (e.g. 13C and 15N). Moreover because labeling is enzymatic, the number of 18O atoms incorporated can vary from peptide to peptide. Finally it is difficult to distinguish highly up-regulated from highly down-regulated or C-terminal peptides. We have developed an algorithm entitled regression analysis applied to mass spectrometry (RAAMS) that automatically, rapidly, and confidently interprets spectra of 18O-labeled peptides without requiring chemical composition information derived from production spectra. The algorithm is able to measure the effective 18O incorporation rate due to variable enzyme substrate specificity of the pseudosubstrater during the isotope exchange reaction and corrects for the 18O0 abundance that remains in the labeled sample when using a two-step digestion/labeling procedure. We have also incorporated a method for distinguishing pure 18O0 from pure 18O2 peptides utilizing impure H218O. The algorithm operates on centroided peak lists and is therefore very fast: nine chromatograms of, on average, 1,168 spectra and containing, on average, 6,761 isotopic clusters were interpreted in, on average, 45 s per chromatogram. RAAMS is fast enough (average, 38 ms/spectrum) to allow the possibility of performing information-dependent MS/MS on a chromatographic time scale on species exceeding predetermined ratio thresholds. We describe in detail the operation of the algorithm and demonstrate its use on datasets with known and unknown ratios. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","title":"A method for automatically interpreting mass spectra of 18O-labeled isotopic clusters","authors":[{"name":"Mason C.J."},{"name":"Therneau T.M."},{"name":"Eckel-Passow J.E."},{"name":"Johnson K.L."},{"name":"Oberg A.L."},{"name":"Olson J.E."},{"name":"Nair K.S."},{"name":"Muddiman D.C."},{"name":"Bergen H.R."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1074/mcp.M600148-MCP200"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Mason Christopher","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"Mason.Christopher@mayo.edu","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Chiarito Rudi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"Chiarito.Rudi@mayo.edu","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:libmprc","biotoolsID":"libmprc","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:21:21Z","name":"libmprc","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:00Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://informatics.mayo.edu/svn/trunk/mprc/raams/doc/index.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"A flex/bison-based Mascot Generic Format (MGF) parser library.","language":["C++"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/kirchnerlab/libmgf/"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":3,"date":"2010-05-07T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Despite the efforts of the mass spectrometry (MS) community to migrate data representation toward modern file formats, legacy text formats still play an important role in MS data processing workflows.

Here, we present a new label-free fast quantitative analysis tool, LFQuant, for high-resolution LC-MS/MS proteomics data based on database searching. It is designed to accept raw data in two common formats (mzXML and Thermo RAW), and database search results from mainstream tools (MASCOT, SEQUEST, and X!Tandem), as input data. LFQuant can handle large-scale label-free data with fractionation such as SDS-PAGE and 2D LC. It is easy to use and provides handy user interfaces for data loading, parameter setting, quantitative analysis, and quantitative data visualization. LFQuant was compared with two common quantification software packages, MaxQuant and IDEAL-Q, on the replication data set and the UPS1 standard data set.

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that underlines various aspects of cellular signaling. A key step to reconstructing signaling networks involves identification of the set of all kinases and their substrates. Experimental characterization of kinase substrates is both expensive and time-consuming. To expedite the discovery of novel substrates, computational approaches based on kinase recognition sequence (motifs) from known substrates, protein structure, interaction and co-localization have been proposed. However, rarely do these methods take into account the dynamic responses of signaling cascades measured from in vivo cellular systems. Given that recent advances in mass spectrometry-based technologies make it possible to quantify phosphorylation on a proteome-wide scale, computational approaches that can integrate static features with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly facilitate the prediction of biologically relevant kinase-specific substrates. Results: Here, we propose a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning approach that integrates dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs to predict novel substrates for kinases of interest. We extended a positive-unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble model, which significantly improves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while retaining high specificity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model using simulation studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key kinases relevant to insulin signaling. Our analyses show that static sequence motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data are complementary and that the proposed integrated model performs better than methods relying only on static information for accurate prediction of kinase-specific substrates.

The utilization of all proteins of an organism of interest deduced from genes of the corresponding genome project in combination with the elimination of obvious membrane proteins permits the creation of an optimized calculated proteome map. The electrophoretic separation behaviour of single proteins is accessible interactively in a Java™ applet (small application in a web browser) by selecting a pI/MW range and an electrophoretic timescale of interest. The calculated pattern of protein spots helps to identify unknown proteins and to localize known proteins during experimental proteomics approaches. Differences between the experimentally observed and the calculated migration behaviour of certain proteins provide first indications for potential protein modification events. When possible, the protein spots are directly linked via a mouse click to the public databases SWISS-PROT and PRODORIC.

Countless proteomics data processing algorithms have been proposed, yet few have been critically evaluated due to lack of labeled data (data with known identities and quantities). Although labeling techniques exist, they are limited in terms of confidence and accuracy. In silico simulators have recently been used to create complex data with known identities and quantities. We propose Java Mass Spectrometry Simulator (JAMSS): a fast, self-contained in silico simulator capable of generating simulated MS and LC-MS runs while providing meta information on the provenance of each generated signal. JAMSS improves upon previous in silico simulators in terms of its ease to install, minimal parameters, graphical user interface, multithreading capability, retention time shift model and reproducibility.","title":"JAMSS: Proteomics mass spectrometry simulation in Java","authors":[{"name":"Smith R."},{"name":"Prince J.T."}]},"pmid":"25371478","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2480"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Rob Smith","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms.cs.umt.edu/","email":"robert.smith@mso.umt.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/princelab/mspire-simulator/blob/master/README.rdoc"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:jamss","biotoolsID":"jamss","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:20:42Z","name":"JAMSS","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:47:17Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://ms.cs.umt.edu/simulation.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Provides a range of services for integrative data analysis in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

It enables users to search for proteins and peptides that have been characterised in mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments from different groups, stored in different databases, and view the collated results with specialist viewers/clients. In order to overcome limitations imposed by the great variability in protein accessions used by individual laboratories, the European Bioinformatics Institute's Protein Identifier Cross-Reference (PICR) service is used to resolve accessions from different sequence repositories. Custom-built clients allow users to view peptide/protein identifications in different contexts from multiple experiments and repositories, as well as integration with the Dasty2 client supporting any annotations available from Distributed Annotation System servers. Further information on the protein hits may also be added via external web services able to take a protein as input.

It allows the calculation of mass values and isotopic distributions based on molecular formulas, peptides/proteins, DNA/RNA, carbohydrate sequences or combinations thereof. In addition, Isotopica takes modifications of the input molecule into consideration using a simple and flexible language as a straight-forward extension of the molecular formula syntax. This function is especially useful for biomolecules, which are often subjected to additional modifications other than normal constituents, such as the frequently occurring post-translational modification in proteins. The isotopic distribution of any molecule thus defined can be calculated by considering full widths at half maximum or mass resolution. The combined envelope of several overlapping isotopic distributions of a mixture of molecules can be determined after specifying each molecule's relative abundance. The results can be displayed graphically on a local PC using the Isotopica viewer, a standalone application that is downloadable from the sites below, as a complement to the client browser. The m/zand intensity values can also be obtained in the form of a plain ASCII text file. The software has proved to be useful for peptide mass fingerprinting and validating an observed isotopic ion distribution with reference to the theoretical one, even from a multi-component sample.

We conclude that the inactivation of Suz12 is associated with changes in the abundance of not only H3K27 methylation but also multiple other PTMs in histone H3 tails.","title":"Middle-down hybrid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry workflow for characterization of combinatorial post-translational modifications in histones","authors":[{"name":"Sidoli S."},{"name":"Schwammle V."},{"name":"Ruminowicz C."},{"name":"Hansen T.A."},{"name":"Wu X."},{"name":"Helin K."},{"name":"Jensen O.N."}]},"pmid":"25073878","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1002/pmic.201400084"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein accession","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2907"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":"Quantification of post-translationally modified peptides, mainly histone peptides Mascot output file","input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence search results","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0857"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Sequence similarity search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0346"},{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"bmb.sdu.dk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Simone Sidoli","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"simone.sidoli@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/middle-down/Software"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:isoscale","biotoolsID":"isoscale","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:20:28Z","name":"isoScale","topic":[{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"},{"term":"Epigenetics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3295"},{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2015-03-06T14:57:57Z","collectionID":["middle-down","Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/middle-down/Software"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A peptide-centric algorithm for protein inference.","language":["Perl"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":31,"date":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"When analyzing proteins in complex samples using tandem mass spectrometry of peptides generated by proteolysis, the inference of proteins can be ambiguous, even with well-validated peptides. Unresolved questions include whether to show all possible proteins vs a minimal list, what to do when proteins are inferred ambiguously, and how to quantify peptides that bridge multiple proteins, each with distinguishing evidence. Here we describe IsoformResolver, a peptide-centric protein inference algorithm that clusters proteins in two ways, one based on peptides experimentally identified from MS/MS spectra, and the other based on peptides derived from an in silico digest of the protein database. MS/MS-derived protein groups report minimal list proteins in the context of all possible proteins, without redundantly listing peptides. In silico-derived protein groups pull together functionally related proteins, providing stable identifiers. The peptide-centric grouping strategy used by IsoformResolver allows proteins to be displayed together when they share peptides in common, providing a comprehensive yet concise way to organize protein profiles. It also summarizes information on spectral counts and is especially useful for comparing results from multiple LC-MS/MS experiments. Finally, we examine the relatedness of proteins within IsoformResolver groups and compare its performance to other protein inference software. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","title":"IsoformResolver: A peptide-centric algorithm for protein inference","authors":[{"name":"Meyer-Arendt K."},{"name":"Old W.M."},{"name":"Houel S."},{"name":"Renganathan K."},{"name":"Eichelberger B."},{"name":"Resing K.A."},{"name":"Ahn N.G."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/pr200039p"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Natalie Ahn","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"natlie.ahn@colorado.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"jison","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:isoformresolver","biotoolsID":"isoformresolver","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:20:25Z","name":"IsoformResolver","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2018-03-13T20:40:37Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167374/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Calculates the isotopic distribution of a chemical formula or a amino acid chain.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Windows"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/binfalse/iso2l"}],"validated":0,"publication":[],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048"},"format":[{"term":"TSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]},{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[{"term":"png","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3603"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Atomic occupancy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1857"},"format":[{"term":"Chemical formula format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2035"}]},{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"Raw sequence format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2571"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Plotting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3441"},{"term":"Isotopic distributions calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3632"},{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://binfalse.de/software/iso2l/iso2l-usage/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:iso2l","biotoolsID":"iso2l","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:20:15Z","name":"iso2l","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:56Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://blog.binfalse.de/software/iso2l/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/iquant-2-0-1-a-pipeline-for-quantitative-proteomics-based-upon-isobaric-tags.html"}],"description":"Automated pipeline for quantitative proteomics based upon isobaric tags.

As the classification of the recorded data points into either 'noise' or 'signal' lies at the very root of essentially every proteomic application, the quality of the automated processing of mass spectra can significantly influence the way the data might be interpreted within a given biological context.Results: We propose non-negative least squares/non-negative least absolute deviation regression to fit a raw spectrum by templates imitating isotope patterns. In a carefully designed validation scheme, we show that the method exhibits excellent performance in pattern picking. It is demonstrated that the method is able to disentangle complicated overlaps of patterns.Conclusions: We find that regularization is not necessary to prevent overfitting and that thresholding is an effective and user-friendly way to perform feature selection. The proposed method avoids problems inherent in regularization-based approaches, comes with a set of well-interpretable parameters whose default configuration is shown to generalize well without the need for fine-tuning, and is applicable to spectra of different platforms.

In addition to filtering, InsPecT also uses novel algorithms for scoring and validating in the presence of modifications, without explicit enumeration of all variants. InsPecT identifies modified peptides with better or equivalent accuracy than other database search tools while being 2 orders of magnitude faster than SEQUEST, and substantially faster than X!TANDEM on complex mixtures.

Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Phosphoproteomics measurements are widely applied in cellular biology to detect changes in signalling dynamics. However, due to the inherent complexity of phosphorylation patterns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are related to functions, it is often not possible to directly deduce protein activities from those measurements. Here, we present a heuristic machine learning algorithm that infers the activities of kinases from Phosphoproteomics data using kinase-target information from the PhosphoSitePlus database. By comparing the estimated kinase activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles, it is furthermore possible to derive the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate the respective phosphosite. Results: We apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell cycle generated from HeLaS3 cells, and insulin signalling dynamics in mouse hepatocytes. In the first case, we estimate the activities of 118 at six cell cycle stages and derive 94 new kinase-phosphosite links that can be validated through either database or motif information. In the second case, the activities of 143 kinases at eight time points are estimated and 49 new kinase-target links are derived.","title":"IKAP: A heuristic framework for inference of kinase activities from Phosphoproteomics data","authors":[{"name":"Mischnik M."},{"name":"Sacco F."},{"name":"Cox J."},{"name":"Schneider H.-C."},{"name":"Schafer M."},{"name":"Hendlich M."},{"name":"Crowther D."},{"name":"Mann M."},{"name":"Klabunde T."}]},"pmid":"26628587","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Statistical inference","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3658"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Marcel Mischnik","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://github.com/marcel-mischnik/IKAP","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/marcel-mischnik/IKAP/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ikap","biotoolsID":"ikap","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:19:20Z","name":"IKAP","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Enzymes","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0821"},{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:46:48Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/marcel-mischnik/IKAP"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ihsp-pseraaac-identifying-the-heat-shock-protein-families.html"}],"description":"This web-server was developed to identify the family of heat shock proteins by using reduced amino acid alphabet.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":143,"date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","abstract":"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a type of functionally related proteins present in all living organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They play essential roles in protein-protein interactions such as folding and assisting in the establishment of proper protein conformation and prevention of unwanted protein aggregation. Their dysfunction may cause various life-threatening disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases. Based on their functions, HSPs are usually classified into six families: (i) HSP20 or sHSP, (ii) HSP40 or J-class proteins, (iii) HSP60 or GroEL/ES, (iv) HSP70, (v) HSP90, and (vi) HSP100. Although considerable progress has been achieved in discriminating HSPs from other proteins, it is still a big challenge to identify HSPs among their six different functional types according to their sequence information alone. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desirable to develop a high-throughput computational tool in this regard. To take up such a challenge, a predictor called iHSP-PseRAAAC has been developed by incorporating the reduced amino acid alphabet information into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition. One of the remarkable advantages of introducing the reduced amino acid alphabet is being able to avoid the notorious dimension disaster or overfitting problem in statistical prediction. It was observed that the overall success rate achieved by iHSP-PseRAAAC in identifying the functional types of HSPs among the aforementioned six types was more than 87%, which was derived by the jackknife test on a stringent benchmark dataset in which none of HSPs included has P40% pairwise sequence identity to any other in the same subset. It has not escaped our notice that the reduced amino acid alphabet approach can also be used to investigate other protein classification problems. As a user-friendly web server, iHSP-PseRAAAC is accessible to the public at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/ server/iHSP-PseRAAAC. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm described here is simple, easy to understand, highly accurate and extremely fast. Instead of the known procedures involving stepwise development or expansion of polynomial expressions, the isotope distributions are calculated by combining precalculated patterns of hypothetical atom clusters. For large organic molecules, the calculation time is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to the stepwise procedure, and accuracy is increased compared to the use of polynomial expressions with inappropriate neglect of smaller terms. Typical examples are discussed to illustrate the scope and limitations of this approach. Additional features of the program are the calculation of isotope peak patterns of mixtures and the calculation of high-resolution masses and intensities for any mass within a given isotope distribution. © 1991.","title":"Calculation of isotope distributions in mass spectrometry.

The bottleneck in quantitative proteomics remains the availability of efficient software to evaluate and quantify the tremendous amount of mass spectral data acquired during a proteomics project. A new software suite, ICPLQuant, has been developed to accurately quantify isotope-coded protein label (ICPL)-labeled peptides on the MS level during LC-MALDI and peptide mass fingerprint experiments. The tool is able to generate a list of differentially regulated peptide precursors for subsequent MS/MS experiments, minimizing time-consuming acquisition and interpretation of MS/MS data. ICPLQuant is based on two independent units. Unit 1 performs ICPL multiplex detection and quantification and proposes peptides to be identified by MS/MS. Unit 2 combines MASCOT MS/MS protein identification with the quantitative data and produces a protein/peptide list with all the relevant information accessible for further data mining. The accuracy of quantification, selection of peptides for MS/MS-identification and the automated output of a protein list of regulated proteins are demonstrated by the comparative analysis of four different mixtures of three proteins (Ovalbumin, Horseradish Peroxidase and Rabbit Albumin) spiked into the complex protein background of the DGPF Proteome Marker. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

potential for the discovery of sequence motif-structural motif-function relationships as the finding of the U-shape (Huf-Zinc) motif, originally a small student's project, exemplifies. The metal ion zinc is critically involved in universal biological processes, ranging from protein-DNA complexes and transcription regulation to enzymatic catalysis and metabolic pathways. Proteins have evolved a series of motifs to specifically recognize and bind zinc ions. Many of these, so called zinc fingers, are structurally independent globular domains with discontinuous binding motifs made up of residues mostly far apart in sequence. Through a systematic approach starting from the BRIX structure fragment database, we discovered that there exists another predictable subset of zinc-binding motifs that not only have a conserved continuous sequence pattern but also share a characteristic local conformation, despite being included in totally different overall folds.

Background: A large proportion of polar anthropogenic compounds routinely released into the environment comprises homologue series, i.e., sets of chemicals differing in a repeating chemical unit. Using analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), these compounds are readily measurable as signal sets with characteristic differences in mass and typically retention time. However, and despite such distinct characteristics, no computational approach for the direct, simultaneous and untargeted detection of all such signal sets comprising both LC and HRMS information has to date been presented. Results: A fast two-staged approach has been developed to extract LC-HRMS signal patterns which can be indicative of homologous analytes. In a first stage, a k-d tree representation of picked LC-HRMS peaks is used to extract all feasible 3-tuples of peaks with restrictions in, e.g., mass defect differences. A second stage then recombines these 3-tuples to larger series tuples while ensuring smooth changes in their retention time characteristics. This unsupervised approach was evaluated for ten effluent samples from Swiss sewage treatment plants (STPs), in both positive and negative electrospray-ionization. Conclusions: Beside recovering all continuous series of previously identified homologues, substantial fractions of nontargeted peaks could subsequently be assigned into very diverse peak series, although assignments were often not unique. The latter ambiguities were resolved by a self-organizing map technique and revealed both distinctive series meshing and rivaling combinatorial solutions in the presence of isobaric or gapped series peaks. When comparing STPs, several ubiquitous yet partially low-frequent series mass differences emerged and may prioritize future identification efforts. The presented algorithm is freely available as part of the R package nontarget and as a user-friendly web-interface at www.envihomolog.eawag.ch. Graphical Abstract Search for systematic series indicative of homologous compounds is based on a partitioned representation of LC-HRMS signal characteristics. This nontargeted search first extracts series triplets in a nearest-neighbour walk and then recombines them to larger ones. For illustration, the two dimensions involving mass defect characteristics are represented by one only.","title":"Nontargeted homologue series extraction from hyphenated high resolution mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Loos M."},{"name":"Singer H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s13321-017-0197-z"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Martin Loos","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"martin.loos@alumni.ethz.ch","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://www.envihomolog.eawag.ch/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:homologous_series_detection","biotoolsID":"homologous_series_detection","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:18:32Z","name":"Homologous Series Detection","topic":[{"term":"Cheminformatics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2258"},{"term":"Mass spectrometry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Computational chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3332"}],"additionDate":"2018-09-01T09:52:14Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://www.envihomolog.eawag.ch/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Function: Rank potential 8-mer, 9-mer, or 10-mer peptides based on a predicted half-time of dissociation to HLA class I molecules.

These data indicate that, for most peptides, each side-chain of the peptide contributes a certain amount to the stability of the HLA-A2 complex that is independent of the sequence of the peptide. To quantify these contributions, the binding data from a set of 154 peptides were combined together to generate a table containing 180 coefficients (20 amino acids x 9 positions), each of which represents the contribution of one particular amino acid residue at a specified position within the peptide to binding to HLA-A2. Eighty peptides formed stable HLA- A2 complexes, as assessed by measuring the rate of dissociation of β2m. The remaining 74 peptides formed complexes that had a half-life of β2m dissociation of less than 5 min at 37°C, or did not bind to HLA-A2, and were included because they could be used to constrain the values of some of the coefficients. The 'theoretical' binding stability (calculated by multiplying together the corresponding coefficients) matched the experimental binding stability to within a factor of 5. The coefficients were then used to calculate the theoretical binding stability for all the previously identified self or antigenic nonamer peptides known to bind to HLA-A2. The binding stability for all other nonamer peptides that could be generated from the proteins from which these peptides were derived was also predicted. In every case, the previously described HLA-A2 binding peptides were ranked in the top 2% of all possible nonamers for each source protein. Therefore, most biologically relevant nonamer peptides should be identifiable using the table of coefficients. We conclude that the side-chains of most nonamer peptides to the first approximation bind independently of one another to the HLA-A2 molecule.","title":"Scheme for ranking potential HLA-A2 binding peptides based on independent binding of individual peptide side-chains","authors":[{"name":"Parker K.C."},{"name":"Bednarek M.A."},{"name":"Coligan J.E."}]},"pmid":"8254189","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide immunogenicity prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0252"},{"term":"Protein-nucleic acid binding prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0420"},{"term":"Protein binding site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"},{"term":"siRNA binding specificity prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0465"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Kenneth Parker","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"kenneth.parker@childrens.harvard.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/hla_motif_search_info.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hla_bind","biotoolsID":"hla_bind","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:18:26Z","name":"Bimas HLA Peptide Binding Predictions","topic":[{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Immunoproteins, genes and antigens","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2830"},{"term":"Protein binding sites","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3534"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"DNA binding sites","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3125"}],"additionDate":"2017-03-30T21:27:42Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Count the number of MS/MS ions in a given spectrum to determine the unambiguous localization of a post-translational modification (PTM).

We conclude that the inactivation of Suz12 is associated with changes in the abundance of not only H3K27 methylation but also multiple other PTMs in histone H3 tails.","title":"Middle-down hybrid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry workflow for characterization of combinatorial post-translational modifications in histones","authors":[{"name":"Sidoli S."},{"name":"Schwammle V."},{"name":"Ruminowicz C."},{"name":"Hansen T.A."},{"name":"Wu X."},{"name":"Helin K."},{"name":"Jensen O.N."}]},"pmid":"25073878","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1002/pmic.201400084"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein features","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1277"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":"Localization of PTMs on histone proteins","input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence search results","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0857"},"format":[{"term":"XML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2332"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Post-translation modification site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"},{"term":"Annotation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"bmb.sdu.dk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Simone Sidoli","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"simone.sidoli@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/middle-down/Software"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:histone_coder","biotoolsID":"histone_coder","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:18:23Z","name":"Histone Coder","topic":[{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"},{"term":"Epigenetics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3295"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2015-04-14T13:57:25Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/middle-down/Software"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/heatmapper-visualizing-various-types-of-data-as-heat-maps.html"}],"description":"Freely available web server that allows users to interactively visualize their data in the form of heat maps through an easy-to-use graphical interface.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":124,"date":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nucleic acids research","abstract":"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Heatmapper is a freely available web server that allows users to interactively visualize their data in the form of heat maps through an easy-to-use graphical interface. Unlike existing non-commercial heat map packages, which either lack graphical interfaces or are specialized for only one or two kinds of heat maps, Heatmapper is a versatile tool that allows users to easily create a wide variety of heat maps for many different data types and applications. More specifically, Heatmapper allows users to generate, cluster and visualize: (i) expression-based heat maps from transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic experiments; (ii) pairwise distance maps; (iii) correlation maps; (iv) image overlay heat maps; (v) latitude and longitude heat maps and (vi) geopolitical (choropleth) heat maps. Heatmapper offers a number of simple and intuitive customization options for facile adjustments to each heat map's appearance and plotting parameters. Heatmapper also allows users to interactively explore their numeric data values by hovering their cursor over each heat map cell, or by using a searchable/sortable data table view. Heat map data can be easily uploaded to Heatmapper in text, Excel or tab delimited formatted tables and the resulting heat map images can be easily downloaded in common formats including PNG, JPG and PDF. Heatmapper is designed to appeal to a wide range of users, including molecular biologists, structural biologists, microbiologists, epidemiologists, environmental scientists, agriculture/forestry scientists, fish and wildlife biologists, climatologists, geologists, educators and students.

If it is, which functional family class does it belong to? It is important to address these questions because GPCRs are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs and the information thus obtained is very useful for \"comparative and evolutionary pharmacology,\" a technique often used for drug development. Here, we present a web-server predictor called \"GPCR-CA,\" where \"CA\" stands for \"Cellular Automaton\" (Wolfram, S. Nature 1984, 311, 419), meaning that the CA images have been utilized to reveal the pattern features hidden in piles of long and complicated protein sequences. Meanwhile, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix factors extracted from the CA images are used to represent the samples of proteins through their pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K.C. Proteins 2001, 43, 246). GPCR-CA is a two-layer predictor: the first layer prediction engine is for identifying a query protein as GPCR on non-GPCR; if it is a GPCR protein, the process will be automatically continued with the second-layer prediction engine to further identify its type among the following six functional classes: (a) rhodopsin-like, (b) secretin-like, (c) metabotrophic/glutamate/pheromone; (d) fungal pheromone, (e) cAMP receptor, and (f) frizzled/smoothened family. The overall success rates by the predictor for the first and second layers are over 91% and 83%, respectively, that were obtained through rigorous jackknife cross-validation tests on a new-constructed stringent benchmark dataset in which none of proteins has ≥40% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset.

Motivation Glycosylation is one of the most heterogeneous and complex protein post-translational modifications. Liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a common high throughput method for analyzing complex biological samples. Accurate study of glycans require high resolution mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry data contains intricate sub-structures that encode mass and abundance, requiring several transformations before it can be used to identify biological molecules, requiring automated tools to analyze samples in a high throughput setting. Existing tools for interpreting the resulting data do not take into account related glycans when evaluating individual observations, limiting their sensitivity. Results We developed an algorithm for assigning glycan compositions from LC-MS data by exploring biosynthetic network relationships among glycans. Our algorithm optimizes a set of likelihood scoring functions based on glycan chemical properties but uses network Laplacian regularization and optionally prior information about expected glycan families to smooth the likelihood and thus achieve a consistent and more representative solution. Our method was able to identify as many, or more glycan compositions compared to previous approaches, and demonstrated greater sensitivity with regularization. Our network definition was tailored to N-glycans but the method may be applied to glycomics data from other glycan families like O-glycans or heparan sulfate where the relationships between compositions can be expressed as a graph.

Non-globular sequence segments often contain short linear peptide motifs (e.g. SH3-binding sites) which are important for protein function. We present here a new tool for discovery of such unstructured, or disordered regions within proteins. GlobPlot (http://globplot.embl.de) is a web service that allows the user to plot the tendency within the query protein for order/globularity and disorder. We show examples with known proteins where it successfully identifies inter-domain segments containing linear motifs, and also apparently ordered regions that do not contain any recognised domain. GlobPlot may be useful in domain hunting efforts. The plots indicate that instances of known domains may often contain additional N- or C-terminal segments that appear ordered. Thus GlobPlot may be of use in the design of constructs corresponding to globular proteins, as needed for many biochemical studies, particularly structural biology. GlobPlot has a pipeline interface - GlobPipe - for the advanced user to do whole proteome analysis.

Unlike previously reported techniques, this method requires no predefined ORF or protein annotations. Fixed-size windows along the genome sequence are scored by an equation accounting for the number of matching peptides, the number of missed enzymatic cleavages in each peptide, the number of in-frame stop codons within a window, the adjacency between peptides, and duplicate peptide matches. Statistical significance of matching regions is assessed by comparing their scores to scores from windows matching randomly generated mass data. Tests with samples from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and Escherichia coli have demonstrated the ability to produce statistically significant identifications, agreeing with two commonly used programs, PEPTIDENT and MASCOT, in 86% of samples analyzed. This genome fingerprint scanning method has the potential to aid in genome annotation, identify proteins for which annotation is incorrect or missing, and handle cases where sequencing errors have caused framing mistakes in the databases. It might also aid in the identification of proteins in which recoding events such as frameshifting or stop-codon read-through have occurred, elucidating alternative translation mechanisms.

However, it has been difficult to fulfill this promise due to over-reliance on identification-based quantitative methods and problems associated with chromatographic separation reproducibility. Here we describe new algorithms termed \"Landmark Matching\" and \"Peak Matching\" that greatly reduce these problems. Landmark Matching performs time base-independent propagation of peptide identities onto accurate mass LC-MS features in a way that leverages historical data derived from disparate data acquisition strategies. Peak Matching builds upon Landmark Matching by recognizing identical molecular species across multiple LC-MS experiments in an identity-independent fashion by clustering. We have bundled these algorithms together with other algorithms, data acquisition strategies, and experimental designs to create a Platform for Experimental Proteomic Pattern Recognition (PEPPeR). These developments enable use of established statistical tools previously limited to microarray analysis for treatment of proteomics data. We demonstrate that the proposed platform can be calibrated across 2.5 orders of magnitude and can perform robust quantification of ratios in both simple and complex mixtures with good precision and error characteristics across multiple sample preparations. We also demonstrate de novo marker discovery based on statistical significance of unidentified accurate mass components that changed between two mixtures. These markers were subsequently identified by accurate mass-driven MS/MS acquisition and demonstrated to be contaminant proteins associated with known proteins whose concentrations were designed to change between the two mixtures. These results have provided a real world validation of the platform for marker discovery. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","title":"PEPPeR, a platform for experimental proteomic pattern recognition","authors":[{"name":"Jaffe J.D."},{"name":"Mani D.R."},{"name":"Leptos K.C."},{"name":"Church G.M."},{"name":"Gillette M.A."},{"name":"Carr S.A."}]},"pmid":"16857664","type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":1130,"date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Nature Genetics","abstract":"","title":"GenePattern 2.0 [2]","authors":[{"name":"Reich M."},{"name":"Liefeld T."},{"name":"Gould J."},{"name":"Lerner J."},{"name":"Tamayo P."},{"name":"Mesirov J.P."}]},"pmid":"16642009","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"Gene expression report format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2058"},{"term":"GCT/Res format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3709"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006"},"format":[{"term":"MAGE-TAB","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3162"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Copy number estimation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3233"},{"term":"Clustering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"},{"term":"Pathway or network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"},{"term":"Expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"},{"term":"Genetic variation analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/download/"},{"note":"Tutorial material","type":["Training material"],"url":"http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/quick-start"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application","Workbench"],"license":"Proprietary","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genepattern","biotoolsID":"genepattern","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:17:10Z","name":"GenePattern","topic":[{"term":"Functional genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0085"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Gene expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0203"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:23Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/software/genepattern/download/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"This tool displays all approved nomenclature within Symbol Reports that contain data curated by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) editors and links to related genomic, phenotypic and proteomic information.

A web interface allows registered users to assign molecular weight and pH gradient profiles to their own 2D gel patterns as well as to link protein identifications to a given spot on the pattern. The website presents all of the submitted 2D gel patterns where the end-user can dynamically display the images or parts of images along with molecular weight, pH profile information and linked protein identification. A collection of images can be selected for the creation of animations from which the user can select sub-regions of interest and unlimited 2D gel patterns for visualization. The website currently presents 233 identifications for 81 gel patterns for Homo sapiens, Methanococcus jannaschii, Pyrococcus furiosus, Shewanella oneidensis, Escherichia coli and Deinococcus radiodurans.","title":"GELBANK: A database of annotated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns of biological systems with completed genomes","authors":[{"name":"Babnigg G."},{"name":"Giometti C.S."}]},"pmid":"14681486","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein molecular weight calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0398"},{"term":"Protein fragment weight comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2929"},{"term":"Query and retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"},{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"},{"term":"Protein identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"György Babnigg","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"csgiometti@anl.gov","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gelbank","biotoolsID":"gelbank","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:16:58Z","name":"GELBANK","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Imaging","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3382"},{"term":"Zoology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3500"},{"term":"Model organisms","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621"}],"additionDate":"2017-04-22T17:35:20Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://gelbank.anl.gov/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Simple peak alignment for gas-chromatography data in R.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":12,"date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"© 2018 Ottensmann et al.

Consequently, there is growing interest in the use of gas chromatography (GC) to investigate the chemical basis of eco-evo-lutionary interactions. Both GC-MS (mass spectrometry) and FID (flame ionization detection) are commonly used to characterise the chemical composition of biological samples such as skin swabs. The resulting chromatograms comprise peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with GC-FID data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present GCalignR, a user-friendly R package for aligning GC-FID data based on retention times. The package was developed specifically for ecological and evolutionary studies that seek to investigate similarity patterns across multiple and often highly variable biological samples, for example representing different sexes, age classes or reproductive stages. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that GCalignR performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that GCalignR will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields.","title":"GCalignR: An R package for aligning gas-chromatography data for ecological and evolutionary studies","authors":[{"name":"Ottensmann M."},{"name":"Stoffel M.A."},{"name":"Nichols H.J."},{"name":"Hoffman J.I."}]},"pmid":"29879149","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC5991698","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0198311"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak calling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3222"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Meinolf Ottensmann","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"meinolf.ottensmann@web.de","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5991698/bin/pone.0198311.s004.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gcalignr","biotoolsID":"gcalignr","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:16:56Z","name":"GCalignR","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0081"},{"term":"Ecology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0610"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-29T09:23:56Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://github.com/mottensmann/GCalignR"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A Proteogenomic tool for Genome Annotation and Global Profiling of Post-translational Modifications in Prokaryotes.","language":["Java","Perl"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":3,"date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","abstract":"© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.Although the number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes is growing rapidly, experimentally verified annotation of prokaryotic genome remains patchy and challenging. To facilitate genome annotation efforts for prokaryotes, we developed an open source software called GAPP for genome annotation and global profiling of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in prokaryotes. With a single command, it provides a standard workflow to validate and refine predicted genetic models and discover diverse PTM events. We demonstrated the utility of GAPP using proteomic data from Helicobacter pylori, one of the major human pathogens that is responsible for many gastric diseases. Our results confirmed 84.9% of the existing predicted H. pylori proteins, identified 20 novel protein coding genes, and corrected four existing gene models with regard to translation initiation sites. In particular, GAPP revealed a large repertoire of PTMs using the same proteomic data and provided a rich resource that can be used to examine the functions of reversible modifications in this human pathogen. This software is a powerful tool for genome annotation and global discovery of PTMs and is applicable to any sequenced prokaryotic organism; we expect that it will become an integral part of ongoing genome annotation efforts for prokaryotes.

Many of these problems can be overcome by obtaining and analyzing hundreds of sequentially overlapping peptide fragments that cover the protein many times over (Mayne et al. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2011: 10.1007/s13361-011-0235-4 ). This paper describes a computer program called ExMS that furthers this advance by making it possible to efficiently process crowded mass spectra and definitively identify and characterize these many peptide fragments. ExMS automatically scans through high resolution MS data to find the individual isotopic peaks and isotopic envelopes of a list of peptides previously identified by MS/MS. It performs a number of tests to ensure correct identification in spite of peptide overlap in both chromatographic and mass spectrometric dimensions and possible multi-modal envelopes due to static or dynamic structural heterogeneity or HX EX1 behavior. The program can automatically process data from many sequential HX time points with no operator intervention at the rate of ∼2 sec per peptide per HX time point using desktop computer equipment, but it also provides for rapid manual checking and decision when ambiguity exists. Additional subroutines can provide a step by step report of performance at each test along the way and parameter adjustment, deconvolute isotopic envelopes, and plot the time course of single and multi-modal H-D exchange.

Evaluating such ESI protein spectra would provide valuable information about the native state of investigated proteins. However, no suitable and freely available software could be found which allows the charge state determination and molecular weight calculation of single proteins from average ESI-MS data. Therefore, an algorithm based on standard deviation optimization (scatter minimization) was implemented for the analysis of protein ESI-MS data. The resulting software ESIprot was tested with ESI-MS data of six intact reference proteins between 12.4 and 66.7kDa. In all cases, the correct charge states could be determined. The obtained absolute mass errors were in a range between -0.2 and 1.2Da, the relative errors below 30ppm. The possible mass accuracy allows for valid conclusions about the actual condition of proteins. Moreover, the ESIprot algorithm demonstrates an extraordinary robustness and allows spectral interpretation from as little as two peaks, given sufficient quality of the provided m/z data, without the necessity for peak intensity data. ESIprot is independent from the raw data format and the computer platform, making it a versatile tool for mass spectrometrists.

mixtures without any separation. First, the method was demonstrated on a mixture of tryptic digests of equine cytochrome c, equine myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. The same method was then applied to human plasma from a healthy blood donor. Computer programs were employed to simplify analysis of the complex spectra. The 2745 peaks in the human plasma electrospray ionization FTICR spectrum could be reduced to 1165 isotopic clusters and 669 unique masses. Out of these, 82 masses matched tryptic fragments of serum albumin with mass measurement errors less than 10 ppm, covering 93% of the sequence. Another 16 masses were assigned to tryptic fragments of transferrin, covering 41% of the sequence on the 10 ppm mass measurement error level (14 within 2 ppm). The mass measurement errors were approximately normal distributed with a standard deviation of 1.7 ppm. This demonstrates the feasibility of combining the ultra-high mass resolving power and accuracy of FTICR mass spectrometry with automated computer analysis for investigating complex biological matrices.

A fast and memory-efficient calculation of theoretical isotope patterns is crucial for the routine interpretation of mass spectrometric data. For high-resolution experiments, calculations must procure the exact masses and probabilities of relevant isotopologues over a wide range of polyisotopic compounds, while pruning low-probable ones. Here, a novel albeit simple treelike structure is introduced to swiftly derive sets of relevant subisotopologues for each element in a molecule, which are then combined to the isotopologues of the full molecule. In contrast to existing approaches, transitions via single replacements of the most abundant isotope per element are used in separable tree branches to derive subisotopologues from each other. Moreover, the underlying transition trees prevent redundant replacements and permit the detection of the most probable isotopologue in a first phase. A relative threshold can then be exploited in a second parallelized phase for a precise prepruning of large fractions of the remaining subisotopologues. The gain in performance from such early pruning and the lower variation in the distortion of simulated data with use of relative rather than absolute thresholds were validated in a large-scale benchmark simulation, unprecedentedly comprising several thousand molecular formulas. Both the algorithm and a wealth of related features are freely available as R-package enviPat and as a user-friendly Web interface.","title":"Accelerated isotope fine structure calculation using pruned transition trees","authors":[{"name":"Loos M."},{"name":"Gerber C."},{"name":"Corona F."},{"name":"Hollender J."},{"name":"Singer H."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00941"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Plot","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884"},"format":[{"term":"JPG","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3579"},{"term":"png","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3603"}]},{"data":{"term":"Report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Chemical formula","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0846"},"format":[{"term":"Chemical formula format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2035"},{"term":"R file format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3554"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Plotting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3441"},{"term":"Isotopic distributions calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3632"},{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Martin Loos","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"martin.loos@alumni.ethz.ch","typeRole":["Maintainer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enviPat/enviPat.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library","Web application"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:envipat","biotoolsID":"envipat","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:16:20Z","name":"enviPat","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:51:55Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.envipat.eawag.ch/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Network-based enrichment analysis","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":168,"date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Motivation: Assessing functional associations between an experimentally derived gene or protein set of interest and a database of known gene/protein sets is a common task in the analysis of large-scale functional genomics data. For this purpose, a frequently used approach is to apply an over-representation-based enrichment analysis. However, this approach has four drawbacks: (i) it can only score functional associations of overlapping gene/proteins sets; (ii) it disregards genes with missing annotations; (iii) it does not take into account the network structure of physical interactions between the gene/protein sets of interest and (iv) tissue-specific gene/protein set associations cannot be recognized. Results: To address these limitations, we introduce an integrative analysis approach and web-application called EnrichNet. It combines a novel graph-based statistic with an interactive sub-network visualization to accomplish two complementary goals: improving the prioritization of putative functional gene/protein set associations by exploiting information from molecular interaction networks and tissue-specific gene expression data and enabling a direct biological interpretation of the results. By using the approach to analyse sets of genes with known involvement in human diseases, new pathway associations are identified, reflecting a dense sub-network of interactions between their corresponding proteins. © The Author(s) 2012.

This library was created by Cohen et al. to study the proteome dynamics of a human lung carcinoma cell-line treated with an anti-cancer drug. Here, we report the Dynamic Proteomics database for the proteins studied by Cohen et al. Each cell-line clone in LARC has a protein tagged with yellow fluorescent protein, expressed from its endogenous chromosomal location, under its natural regulation. The Dynamic Proteomics interface facilitates searches for genes of interest, downloads of protein fluorescent movies and alignments of dynamics following drug addition. Each protein in the database is displayed with its annotation, cDNA sequence, fluorescent images and movies obtained by the time-lapse microscopy. The protein dynamics in the database represents a quantitative trace of the protein fluorescence levels in nucleus and cytoplasm produced by image analysis of movies over time. Furthermore, a sequence analysis provides a search and comparison of up to 50 input DNA sequences with all cDNAs in the library. The raw movies may be useful as a benchmark for developing image analysis tools for individual-cell dynamic-proteomics.

Disordered regions in proteins often contain short linear peptide motifs (e.g., SH3 ligands and targeting signals) that are important for protein function. We present here DisEMBL, a computational tool for prediction of disordered/unstructured regions within a protein sequence. As no clear definition of disorder exists, we have developed parameters based on several alternative definitions and introduced a new one based on the concept of \"hot loops,\" i.e., coils with high temperature factors. Avoiding potentially disordered segments in protein expression constructs can increase expression, foldability, and stability of the expressed protein. DisEMBL is thus useful for target selection and the design of constructs as needed for many biochemical studies, particularly structural biology and structural genomics projects.

Feature detection is difficult because of the high complexity of MS proteomics data from biological samples, which frequently causes features to intermingle. In addition, existing feature detection algorithms commonly suffer from compatibility issues, long computation times, or poor performance on high-resolution data. Because of these limitations, we developed a new tool, Dinosaur, with increased speed and versatility. Dinosaur has the functionality to sample algorithm computations through quality-control plots, which we call a plot trail. From the evaluation of this plot trail, we introduce several algorithmic improvements to further improve the robustness and performance of Dinosaur, with the detection of features for 98% of MS/MS identifications in a benchmark data set, and no other algorithm tested in this study passed 96% feature detection. We finally used Dinosaur to reimplement a published workflow for peptide identification in chimeric spectra, increasing chimeric identification from 26% to 32% over the standard workflow.

First, the method was demonstrated on a mixture of tryptic digests of equine cytochrome c, equine myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. The same method was then applied to human plasma from a healthy blood donor. Computer programs were employed to simplify analysis of the complex spectra. The 2745 peaks in the human plasma electrospray ionization FTICR spectrum could be reduced to 1165 isotopic clusters and 669 unique masses. Out of these, 82 masses matched tryptic fragments of serum albumin with mass measurement errors less than 10 ppm, covering 93% of the sequence. Another 16 masses were assigned to tryptic fragments of transferrin, covering 41% of the sequence on the 10 ppm mass measurement error level (14 within 2 ppm). The mass measurement errors were approximately normal distributed with a standard deviation of 1.7 ppm. This demonstrates the feasibility of combining the ultra-high mass resolving power and accuracy of FTICR mass spectrometry with automated computer analysis for investigating complex biological matrices.

Despite methodological advancements and improvements in instrumentation and automation, data analysis and display remains a tedious process. The factors that contribute to this bottleneck are the large number of data points produced in a typical experiment, each requiring manual curation and validation, and then calculation of the level of backbone amide exchange. Tools have become available that address some of these issues, but lack sufficient integration, functionality, and accessibility required to address the needs of the H/D exchange community. To date there is no software for the analysis of H/D exchange data that comprehensively addresses these issues. Results: We have developed an integrated software system for the automated analysis and representation of H/D exchange data that has been titled \"The Deuterator\". Novel approaches have been implemented that enable high throughput analysis, automated determination of deuterium incorporation, and deconvolution of overlapping peptides. This has been achieved by using methods involving iterative theoretical envelope fitting, and consideration of peak data within expected m/z ranges. Existing common file formats have been leveraged to allow compatibility with the output from the myriad of MS instrument platforms and peptide sequence database search engines. A web-based interface is used to integrate the components of The Deuterator that are able to analyze and present mass spectral data from instruments with varying resolving powers. The results, if necessary, can then be confirmed, adjusted, re-calculated and saved. Additional tools synchronize the curated calculation parameters with replicate time points, increasing throughput. Saved results can then be used to plot deuterium buildup curves and 3D structural overlays.

Motivation: Using mass spectrometry to measure the concentration and turnover of the individual proteins in a proteome, enables the calculation of individual synthesis and degradation rates for each protein. Software to analyze concentration is readily available, but software to analyze turnover is lacking. Data analysis workflows typically don't access the full breadth of information about instrument precision and accuracy that is present in each peptide isotopic envelope measurement. This method utilizes both isotope distribution and changes in neutromer spacing, which benefits the analysis of both concentration and turnover. Results: We have developed a data analysis tool, DeuteRater, to measure protein turnover from metabolic D2O labeling. DeuteRater uses theoretical predictions for label-dependent change in isotope abundance and inter-peak (neutromer) spacing within the isotope envelope to calculate protein turnover rate. We have also used these metrics to evaluate the accuracy and precision of peptide measurements and thereby determined the optimal data acquisition parameters of different instruments, as well as the effect of data processing steps. We show that these combined measurements can be used to remove noise and increase confidence in the protein turnover measurement for each protein.

Some peptides can be identified using spectral matching programs like Sequest or Mascot, but many spectra do not produce high quality database matches. De novo peptide sequencing is an approach to determine partial peptide sequences for some of the unidentified spectra. A drawback of de novo peptide sequencing is that it produces a series of ordered and disordered sequence tags and mass tags rather than a complete, non-degenerate peptide amino acid sequence. This incomplete data is difficult to use in conventional search programs such as BLAST or FASTA. DeNovoID is a program that has been specifically designed to use degenerate amino acid sequence and mass data derived from MS experiments to search a peptide database. Since the algorithm employed depends on the amino acid composition of the peptide and not its sequence, DeNovoID does not have to consider all possible sequences, but rather a smaller number of compositions consistent with a spectrum. DeNovoID also uses a geometric indexing scheme that reduces the number of calculations required to determine the best peptide match in the database.

To evaluate these choices on a proteome scale, we compared triplicate measurements of the yeast proteome by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using linear ion trap (LTQ) and hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF; QSTAR) mass spectrometers. Acquired MS/MS spectra were interpreted with Mascot and SEQUEST algorithms with and without the requirement that all returned peptides be tryptic. Using a composite target decoy database strategy, we selected scoring criteria yielding 1% estimated false positive identifications at maximum sensitivity for all data sets, allowing reasonable comparisons between them. These comparisons indicate that Mascot and SEQUEST yield similar results for LTQ-acquired spectra but less so for QSTAR spectra. Furthermore, low reproducibility between replicate data acquisitions made on one or both instrument platforms can be exploited to increase sensitivity and confidence in large-scale protein identifications.","title":"Comparative evaluation of mass spectrometry platforms used in large-scale proteomics investigations","authors":[{"name":"Elias J.E."},{"name":"Haas W."},{"name":"Faherty B.K."},{"name":"Gygi S.P."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth785"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA-like","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2546"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Protein sequence","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2976"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA-like","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2546"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Random sequence generation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0364"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.matrixscience.com/help/decoy_help.html#MANUAL"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:decoy.pl","biotoolsID":"decoy.pl","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:15:17Z","name":"decoy.pl","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:52:01Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.matrixscience.com/help/decoy_help.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Advanced peak picking of MS and LC-MS(/MS) data using THRASH and other algorithms.","language":["C#"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://ncrr.pnl.gov/software/sourcecode_register.asp?id=18"},{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/DeconTools"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":419,"date":"2000-12-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"Here a fully automated computer algorithm is applied to complex mass spectra of peptides and proteins. This method uses a subtractive peak finding routine to locate possible isotopic clusters in the spectrum, subjecting these to a combination of the previous Fourier transform/Patterson method for primary charge determination and the method for least-squares fitting to a theoretically derived isotopic abundance distribution for m/z determination of the most abundant isotopic peak, and the statistical reliability of this determination. If a predicted protein sequence is available, each such m/z value is checked for assignment as a sequence fragment. A new signal-to-noise calculation procedure has been devised for accurate determination of baseline and noise width for spectra with high peak density. In 2 h, the program identified 824 isotopic clusters representing 581 mass values in the spectrum of a GluC digest of a 191 kDa protein; this is >50% more than the number of mass values found by the extremely tedious operator-applied methodology used previously.

Interpreting this data involves inferring the masses and abundances of biomolecules injected into the instrument. Because of the inherent complexity of mass spectral patterns produced by these biomolecules, the analysis is significantly enhanced by using visualization capabilities to inspect and confirm results. In this paper we describe Decon2LS, an open-source software package for automated processing and visualization of high-resolution MS data. Drawing extensively on algorithms developed over the last ten years for ICR2LS, Decon2LS packages the algorithms as a rich set of modular, reusable processing classes for performing diverse functions such as reading raw data, routine peak finding, theoretical isotope distribution modelling, and deisotoping. Because the source code is openly available, these functionalities can now be used to build derivative applications in relatively fast manner. In addition, Decon2LS provides an extensive set of visualization tools, such as high performance chart controls. Results: With a variety of options that include peak processing, deisotoping, isotope composition, etc, Decon2LS supports processing of multiple raw data formats. Deisotoping can be performed on an individual scan, an individual dataset, or on multiple datasets using batch processing. Other processing options include creating a two dimensional view of mass and liquid chromatography (LC) elution time features, generating spectrum files for tandem MS data, creating total intensity chromatograms, and visualizing theoretical peptide profiles. Application of Decon2LS to deisotope different datasets obtained across different instruments yielded a high number of features that can be used to identify and quantify peptides in the biological sample. Conclusion: Decon2LS is an efficient software package for discovering and visualizing features in proteomics studies that require automated interpretation of mass spectra. Besides being easy to use, fast, and reliable, Decon2LS is also open-source, which allows developers in the proteomics and bioinformatics communities to reuse and refine the algorithms to meet individual needs. © 2009 Jaitly et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Decon2LS: An open-source software package for automated processing and visualization of high resolution mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Jaitly N."},{"name":"Mayampurath A."},{"name":"Littlefield K."},{"name":"Adkins J.N."},{"name":"Anderson G.A."},{"name":"Smith R.D."}]},"pmid":"19292916","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-10-87"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Peptide mass fingerprint","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0944"},"format":[{"term":"CSV","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752"},{"term":"dat","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1637"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"WIFF format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3710"},{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"},{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"},{"term":"mzXML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3654"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Chromatogram visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3203"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"},{"term":"Isotopic distributions calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3632"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://ms-utils.org","email":"webmaster@ms-utils.org","typeRole":["Documentor"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"msutils_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://omics.pnl.gov/software/decontools-decon2ls"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://omics.pnl.gov/sites/default/files/software/DeconTools_Tutorial.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:decontools","biotoolsID":"decontools","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:15:12Z","name":"DeconTools","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:50:58Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://omics.pnl.gov/software/DeconTools.php"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org"}],"description":"Tool for accurate precursor ion monoisotopic mass determination for tandem mass spectra.","language":["C++"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://omics.pnl.gov/sites/default/files/software/DeconMSn_SourceAndSupportingDLLs.zip"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":98,"date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Summary: DeconMSn accurately determines the monoisotopic mass and charge state of parent ions from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data, offering significant improvement for LTQ_FT and LTQ_Orbitrap instruments over the commercially delivered Thermo Fisher Scientific's extract_msn tool.

Years of effort from scientists and doctors worldwide have generated large amounts of data at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and even metabolome level, and DNA and RNA cancer signature databases have been established. Here we present a database of differentially expressed proteins in human cancers (dbDEPC), with the goal of collecting curated cancer proteomics data, providing a resource for information on protein-level expression changes, and exploring protein profile differences among different cancers. dbDEPC currently contains 1803 proteins differentially expressed in 15 cancers, curated from 65 mass spectrometry (MS) experiments in peer-reviewed publications. In addition to MS experiments, low-throughput experiment data from the same literatures and cancer-associated genes from external databases were also integrated to provide some validation information. Furthermore, dbDEPC associates differential proteins with important structural variations in the human genome, such as copy number variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms, which might be helpful for explaining changes in protein expression at the DNA level. Data in dbDEPC can be queried by protein identifier, description or sequence; the retrieved protein entry provides the differential expression pattern seen in cancers, along with detailed annotations. dbDEPC is expected to be a reference database for cancer signatures at the protein level.

In 2009, we published the first database of DEPs in human cancers (dbDEPCs). In this updated version of 2011, dbDEPC 2.0 has more than doubly expanded to over 4000 protein entries, curated from 331 experiments across 20 types of human cancers. This resource allows researchers to search whether their interested proteins have been reported changing in certain cancers, to compare their own proteomic discovery with previous studies, to picture selected protein expression heatmap across multiple cancers and to relate protein expression changes with aberrance in other genetic level. New important developments include addition of experiment design information, advanced filter tools for customer-specified analysis and a network analysis tool.

Bioinformatics 2001: 17: 509-519) and implemented in the Cyber-T web server, is one of the most widely validated. Cyber-T implements a t-test using a Bayesian framework to compute a regularized variance of the measurements associated with each probe under each condition. This regularized estimate is derived by flexibly combining the empirical measurements with a prior, or background, derived from pooling measurements associated with probes in the same neighborhood. This approach flexibly addresses problems associated with low replication levels and technology biases, not only for DNA microarrays, but also for other technologies, such as protein arrays, quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq). Here we present an update to the Cyber-T web server, incorporating several useful new additions and improvements. Several preprocessing data normalization options including logarithmic and (Variance Stabilizing Normalization) VSN transforms are included. To augment two-sample t-tests, a one-way analysis of variance is implemented.

Accordingly, several bioinformatics methods have been successfully developed and employed to select crystallizable proteins. Unfortunately, the majority of existing in silico methods only allow the prediction of crystallization propensity, seldom enabling computational design of protein mutants that can be targeted for enhancing protein crystallizability. Here, we present Crysalis, an integrated crystallization analysis tool that builds on support-vector regression (SVR) models to facilitate computational protein crystallization prediction, analysis, and design. More specifically, the functionality of this new tool includes: (1) rapid selection of target crystallizable proteins at the proteome level, (2) identification of site non-optimality for protein crystallization and systematic analysis of all potential single-point mutations that might enhance protein crystallization propensity, and (3) annotation of target protein based on predicted structural properties. We applied the design mode of Crysalis to identify site non-optimality for protein crystallization on a proteome-scale, focusing on proteins currently classified as non-crystallizable. Our results revealed that site non-optimality is based on biases related to residues, predicted structures, physicochemical properties, and sequence loci, which provides in-depth understanding of the features influencing protein crystallization.","title":"Crysalis: An integrated server for computational analysis and design of protein crystallization","authors":[{"name":"Wang H."},{"name":"Feng L."},{"name":"Zhang Z."},{"name":"Webb G.I."},{"name":"Lin D."},{"name":"Song J."}]},"pmid":"26906024","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC4764925","version":null,"doi":"10.1038/srep21383"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Sequence record","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0849"},"format":[{"term":"FASTA","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein crystallizability prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0410"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Regression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein secondary structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Huilin Wang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"whl080500422@sina.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Huilin Wang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"20520140153971@stu.xmu.edu.cn","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"migle_sur","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["Training material"],"url":"http://nmrcen.xmu.edu.cn/crysalis/Datasets.html"},{"note":"Description of method","type":["General"],"url":"http://nmrcen.xmu.edu.cn/crysalis/Method.html"},{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://nmrcen.xmu.edu.cn/crysalis/FAQ.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:crysalis","biotoolsID":"crysalis","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:14:27Z","name":"Crysalis","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"}],"additionDate":"2018-05-20T15:39:02Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://nmrcen.xmu.edu.cn/crysalis/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://ms-utils.org/"}],"description":"Repository and statistical tools for directly determined PTM crosstalk based on long peptides measured by mass spectrometry.

One of the most important challenges in current chromatin biology is to characterize the relationships between co-existing histone marks, the order and hierarchy of their deposition, and their distinct biological functions. We developed the database CrossTalkDB to organize observed and reported co-existing histone marks as revealed by MS experiments of histone proteins and their derived peptides. Statistical assessment revealed sample-specific patterns for the co-frequency of histone post-translational modifications. We implemented a new method to identify positive and negative interplay between pairs of methylation and acetylation marks in proteins. Many of the detected features were conserved between different cell types or exist across species, thereby revealing general rules for cross-talk between histone marks. The observed features are in accordance with previously reported examples of cross-talk. We observed novel types of interplay among acetylated residues, revealing positive cross-talk between nearby acetylated sites but negative cross-talk for distant ones, and for discrete methylation states at Lys-9, Lys-27, and Lys-36 of histone H3, suggesting a more differentiated functional role of methylation beyond the general expectation of enhanced activity at higher methylation states. ©

The combined platform of LC-MS (Liquid-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry) has shown promise in moving toward a solution in these areas. In this paper we present atechnique for discovering differences in protein signal between two classes of samples of LC-MS serum proteomic data without use of tandem mass spectrometry, gels or labeling. This method works on data from a lower-precision MS instrument, the type routinely used by and available to the community at large today. We test our technique on a controlled (spike-in) but realistic (serum biomarker discovery) experiment which is therefore verifiable. We also develop a new method for helping to assess the difficulty of a given spike-in problem. Lastly, we show that the problem of class prediction, sometimes mistaken as a solution to biomarker discovery, is actually a much simpler problem. Results: Using precision - recall curves with experimentally extracted ground truth, we show that (1) our technique has good performance using seven replicates from each class, (2) performance degrades with decreasing number of replicates, (3) the signal that we are teasing out is not trivially available (i.e. the differences are not so large that the task is easy). Lastly, we easily obtain perfect classification results for data in which the problem of extracting differences does not produce absolutely perfect results.

Currently available interaction databases, being largely complementary to each other, must be integrated to obtain a comprehensive global map of the different types of interactions. We have previously reported the development of an integrative interaction database called ConsensusPathDB (http://ConsensusPathDB. org) that aims to fulfill this task. In this update article, we report its significant progress in terms of interaction content and web interface tools. ConsensusPathDB has grown mainly due to the integration of 12 further databases; it now contains 215 541 unique interactions and 4601 pathways from overall 30 databases. Binary protein interactions are scored with our confidence assessment tool, IntScore. The ConsensusPathDB web interface allows users to take advantage of these integrated interaction and pathway data in different contexts. Recent developments include pathway analysis of metabolite lists, visualization of functional gene/metabolite sets as overlap graphs, gene set analysis based on protein complexes and induced network modules analysis that connects a list of genes through various interaction types. To facilitate the interactive, visual interpretation of interaction and pathway data, we have re-implemented the graph visualization feature of ConsensusPathDB using the Cytoscape.js library. © The Author(s) 2012.","title":"The ConsensusPathDB interaction database: 2013 Update","authors":[{"name":"Kamburov A."},{"name":"Stelzl U."},{"name":"Lehrach H."},{"name":"Herwig R."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gks1055"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Project","name":"BioCatalogue","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.biocatalogue.org","email":null,"typeRole":["Documentor"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"BioCatalogue","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Web service"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cpdb","biotoolsID":"cpdb","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:14:05Z","name":"cpdb","topic":[{"term":"Protein interactions","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0128"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2015-08-03T09:36:41Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Using molecular dynamics trajectories, analyzes inter-residue contacts, creates videos of time-resolved contact maps, and performs correlation, principal component, and cluster analysis, revealing how specific contacts relate to functionally relevant states sampled by molecular dynamics.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":3,"date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","journal":"Biophysical Journal","abstract":"© 2018 Biophysical SocietyThe analysis of contacts is a powerful tool to understand biomolecular function in a series of contexts, from the investigation of dynamical behavior at equilibrium to the study of nonequilibrium dynamics in which the system moves between multiple states. We thus propose a tool called CONtact ANalysis (CONAN) that, from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, analyzes interresidue contacts, creates videos of time-resolved contact maps, and performs correlation, principal component, and cluster analysis, revealing how specific contacts relate to functionally relevant states sampled by MD. We present how CONAN can identify features describing the dynamics of ubiquitin both at equilibrium and during mechanical unfolding. Additionally, we show the analysis of MD trajectories of an α-synuclein mutant peptide that undergoes an α-β conformational transition that can be easily monitored using CONAN, which identifies the multiple states that the peptide explores along its conformational dynamics. The high versatility and ease of use of the software make CONAN a tool that can significantly facilitate the understanding of the complex dynamical behavior of proteins or other biomolecules.

While several techniques are available for the detection of significant peaks in individual samples, it is still difficult to determine small differences between similar samples. Using conventional software, visual inspections of individual chromatograms or individual mass spectra are often of little use because the differences in the composition of small molecules are too small to be recognizable. Thus, we developed a new approach to visualizing mass spectral datasets using a tool that allows one to easily detect these small differences between mass spectra and chromatograms derived from matched samples. Using these tools on extracts from wild-type and methyltransferase knockout strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we were able to readily identify those mass spectra in our data sets that were different between the wild-type and the knockout extracts and to identify the molecules involved. The software was also successfully applied to a set of LC/MS data from peptide digests that were performed with identical substrates but different enzymes.

And even though the purpose of these tools can vary significantly, they usually share a basic set of features, including the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the visualization of (and interaction with) spectra and chromatograms, and the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines. Developers typically spend considerable time and effort implementing these support structures, which detracts from working on the novel aspects of their tool.Results: In order to simplify the development of proteomics tools, we have implemented an open-source support library for computational proteomics, called compomics-utilities. The library contains a broad set of features required for reading, parsing, and analyzing proteomics data. compomics-utilities is already used by a long list of existing software, ensuring library stability and continued support and development.Conclusions: As a user-friendly, well-documented and open-source library, compomics-utilities greatly simplifies the implementation of the basic features needed in most proteomics tools. Implemented in 100% Java, compomics-utilities is fully portable across platforms and architectures. Our library thus allows the developers to focus on the novel aspects of their tools, rather than on the basic functions, which can contribute substantially to faster development, and better tools for proteomics. © 2011 Barsnes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Compomics-utilities: An open-source Java library for computational proteomics","authors":[{"name":"Barsnes H."},{"name":"Vaudel M."},{"name":"Colaert N."},{"name":"Helsens K."},{"name":"Sickmann A."},{"name":"Berven F.S."},{"name":"Martens L."}]},"pmid":"21385435","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":"PMC3060842","version":null,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-12-70"}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Image","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2968"},"format":[]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"ugent.be","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Martens Lennart","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"lennart.martens@ugent.be","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"Katrijn.Vannerum@ugent.be","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://compomics.github.io/projects/compomics-utilities.html"}],"community":null,"version":["4.3.18"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:compomics-utilities","biotoolsID":"compomics-utilities","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:13:51Z","name":"Compomics-utilities","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"}],"additionDate":"2016-05-17T10:18:27Z","collectionID":["BIG N2N","Proteomics","VIB","Compomics","UGent"],"homepage":"http://compomics.github.io/projects/compomics-utilities.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Predicting peptide signatures for targeted proteomics.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":6,"date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"We have created a new software platform called sigpep that analyzes transition redundancy in selected reaction monitoring assays.

Mass spectrometry is used routinely for bacterial identification and has also been used for phylogenetic analysis, for instance from bone material. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the acquired tandem mass spectra allow direct interpretation. Methods: We describe a new algorithm and software for molecular phylogenetics using pairwise comparisons of tandem mass spectra from enzymatically digested proteins. The spectra need not be annotated and all acquired data is used in the analysis. To demonstrate the method, we analyzed tryptic digests of sera from four great apes and two other primates. Results: The distribution of spectra dot products for thousands of tandem mass spectra collected from two samples provides a measure on the fraction of shared peptides between the two samples. When inverted, this becomes a distance metric. By pairwise comparison between species and averaging over four individuals per species, it was possible to reconstruct the unique correct phylogenetic tree for the great apes and other primates. Conclusions: The new method described here has several attractive features compared with existing methods, among them simplicity, the unbiased use of all acquired data rather than a small subset of spectra, and the potential use of heavily degraded proteins or proteins with a priori unknown modifications. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","title":"Molecular phylogenetics by direct comparison of tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Palmblad M."},{"name":"Deelder A.M."}]},"pmid":"22368051","type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1002/rcm.6162"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Rationale Peptide tandem mass spectra can be analyzed by a number of means. They can be compared against predicted spectra of peptides derived from genome sequences, compared against previously acquired and identified spectra, or - sometimes - sequenced de novo. We recently introduced another method which compares spectra between liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) datasets to determine the shared spectral content, and demonstrated how this can be applied in a molecular phylogenetic study using sera from human and non-human primates. We will here explore if such a method have other, serendipitous uses. Methods We used the existing compareMS2 algorithm without modification on a diverse set of experiments. Results First we conducted a small phylogenetic study, using (mammalian) bone samples to study old material, and human pathogens aiming to distinguish clinically important strains. Although not as straightforward as primate sera analysis, the method shows significant promise for all these applications. We also used the algorithm to compare 24 different protocols for extraction of proteins from muscle tissue. The results provided useful information in comparing protocols. Finally, we applied compareMS2 aiming for quality control of two traceable protein reference standards (troponin) used in clinical chemistry assays, by analysing the effect of storage conditions. Conclusions The results illustrate a broad applicability of the metric based on shared tandem mass spectra between LC/MS/MS datasets for analysing protein digests in different types of experiments. There is no reason to assume that our instance of this method is optimal in any of these situations, as it makes limited or no use of accurate mass and chromatographic retention time. We propose that with further improvement and refinement, this type of analysis can be applied as a simple but informative first step in many pipelines for bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry data analysis in proteomics and other fields, comparing or analysing large numbers of samples or datasets.","title":"Differentiating samples and experimental protocols by direct comparison of tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Van Der Plas-Duivesteijn S.J."},{"name":"Wulff T."},{"name":"Klychnikov O."},{"name":"Ohana D."},{"name":"Dalebout H."},{"name":"Van Veelen P.A."},{"name":"De Keijzer J."},{"name":"Nessen M.A."},{"name":"Van Der Burgt Y.E.M."},{"name":"Deelder A.M."},{"name":"Palmblad M."}]},"pmid":"26864526","type":["Other"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Version information","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0953"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"}]}],"note":null,"input":[{"data":{"term":"Version information","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0953"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"}]}],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Comparison","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2424"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"lumc.nl","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://www.lumc.nl","email":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5865-8994","typeEntity":null,"name":"Magnus Palmblad","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"magnus.palmblad@gmail.com","typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5865-8994","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Magnus Palmblad","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"magnus.palmblad@gmail.com","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.ms-utils.org/compareMS2.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:comparems2","biotoolsID":"comparems2","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:13:35Z","name":"compareMS2","topic":[{"term":"Phylogeny","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0084"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2016-04-15T11:52:42Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.ms-utils.org/compareMS2.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/comet-ms/files/"}],"description":"Comet is an open source tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequence database search tool.","language":["C++"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/comet-ms/files/"},{"note":null,"type":"Binaries","version":null,"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/comet-ms/files/"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":313,"date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Proteomics","abstract":"Proteomics research routinely involves identifying peptides and proteins via MS/MS sequence database search.

With CombiROC data from different domains, such as proteomics and transcriptomics, can be analyzed using sensitivity/specificity filters: the number of candidate marker panels rising from combinatorial analysis is easily optimized bypassing limitations imposed by the nature of different experimental approaches. Leaving to the user full control on initial selection stringency, CombiROC computes sensitivity and specificity for all markers combinations, performances of best combinations and ROC curves for automatic comparisons, all visualized in a graphic interface. CombiROC was designed without hard-coded thresholds, allowing a custom fit to each specific data: this dramatically reduces the computational burden and lowers the false negative rates given by fixed thresholds. The application was validated with published data, confirming the marker combination already originally described or even finding new ones.

By collapsing structural diversity to a handful of parameters, such methods can be used to delineate the space of designable structures (i.e., conformations that can be stabilized with a large number of sequences)-a crucial task for de novo protein design. We first demonstrate this on natural α-helical coiled coils using the Crick parameterization. We show that over 95% of known coiled-coil structures are within A1-Å Cα root mean square deviation of a Crick-ideal backbone. Derived parameters show that natural geometric space of coiled coils is highly restricted and can be represented by \"allowed\" conformations amidst a potential continuum of conformers. Allowed structures have (1) restricted axial offsets between helices, which differ starkly between parallel and anti-parallel structures; (2) preferred superhelical radii, which depend linearly on the oligomerization state; (3) pronounced radius-dependent a- and d-position amino acid propensities; and (4) discrete angles of rotation of helices about their axes, which are surprisingly independent of oligomerization state or orientation. In all, we estimate the space of designable coiled-coil structures to be reduced at least 160-fold relative to the space of geometrically feasible structures. To extend the benefits of structural parameterization to other systems, we developed a general mathematical framework for parameterizing arbitrary helical structures, which reduces to the Crick parameterization as a special case. The method is successfully validated on a set of non-coiled-coil helical bundles, frequent in channels and transporter proteins, which show significant helix bending but not supercoiling.

The analysis of these socalled stable isotope fingerprints (SIFs) for microbes involved in biogeochemical cycling and microbiota of plants and animals has led to major discoveries in environmental microbiology. Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide low taxonomic resolution, such as the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as nanoscale secondary ion MS imaging of single cells. Here we present \"direct protein-SIF\" and the Calis-p software package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/), which enable highthroughput measurements of accurate δ13C values for individual species within a microbial community. We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold-standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Using mock community samples, we demonstrate that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community. Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteria-animal symbiosis shows that direct protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected insights into the symbionts' metabolism. This confirms the usefulness of this approach to accurately determine δ13C values for different species in microbial community samples.","title":"Metaproteomics method to determine carbon sources and assimilation pathways of species in microbial communities","authors":[{"name":"Kleiner M."},{"name":"Dong X."},{"name":"Hinzke T."},{"name":"Wippler J."},{"name":"Thorson E."},{"name":"Mayer B."},{"name":"Strous M."}]},"pmid":"29844191","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC6004456","version":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1722325115"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Manuel Kleiner","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"manuel_kleiner@ncsu.edu","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://sourceforge.net/p/calis-p/wiki/Home/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:calis-p","biotoolsID":"calis-p","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:13:01Z","name":"Calis-p","topic":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Microbiology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3301"}],"additionDate":"2018-08-05T09:00:46Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/cab-align-residue-residue-contact-area-based-alignment.html"}],"description":"Contact area-based alignment is a flexible protein structure alignment method based on the residue-residue contact area.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":0,"date":"2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"© 2015 Terashi, Takeda-Shitaka. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Proteins are flexible, and this flexibility has an essential functional role. Flexibility can be observed in loop regions, rearrangements between secondary structure elements, and conformational changes between entire domains. However, most protein structure alignment methods treat protein structures as rigid bodies. Thus, these methods fail to identify the equivalences of residue pairs in regions with flexibility. In this study, we considered that the evolutionary relationship between proteins corresponds directly to the residue-residue physical contacts rather than the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of proteins. Thus, we developed a new protein structure alignment method, contact area-based alignment (CABalign), which uses the residue-residue contact area to identify regions of similarity. The main purpose of CAB-align is to identify homologous relationships at the residue level between related protein structures. The CAB-align procedure comprises two main steps: First, a rigid-body alignment method based on local and global 3D structure superposition is employed to generate a sufficient number of initial alignments. Then, iterative dynamic programming is executed to find the optimal alignment. We evaluated the performance and advantages of CAB-align based on four main points: (1) agreement with the gold standard alignment, (2) alignment quality based on an evolutionary relationship without 3D coordinate superposition, (3) consistency of the multiple alignments, and (4) classification agreement with the gold standard classification. Comparisons of CAB-align with other state-ofthe-art protein structure alignment methods (TM-align, FATCAT, and DaliLite) using our benchmark dataset showed that CAB-align performed robustly in obtaining high-quality alignments and generating consistent multiple alignments with high coverage and accuracy rates, and it performed extremely well when discriminating between homologous and nonhomologous pairs of proteins in both single and multi-domain comparisons.

Lots of methods for finding binding sites involve 3D structure comparison. Here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3D structures.

Typically, protein function annotation relies on homology, and function is inferred from other proteins with similar sequences. This approach has become popular in bacterial genomics because it is one of the few methods that is practical for large datasets and because it does not require additional functional genomics experiments. However, the existing solutions produce erroneous predictions in many cases, especially when query sequences have low levels of identity with the annotated source protein. This problem has created a pressing need for improvements in homology-based annotation.Results: We present an automated method for the functional annotation of bacterial protein sequences. Based on sequence similarity searches, BLANNOTATOR accurately annotates query sequences with one-line summary descriptions of protein function. It groups sequences identified by BLAST into subsets according to their annotation and bases its prediction on a set of sequences with consistent functional information. We show the results of BLANNOTATOR's performance in sets of bacterial proteins with known functions. We simulated the annotation process for 3090 SWISS-PROT proteins using a database in its state preceding the functional characterisation of the query protein. For this dataset, our method outperformed the five others that we tested, and the improved performance was maintained even in the absence of highly related sequence hits. We further demonstrate the value of our tool by analysing the putative proteome of Lactobacillus crispatus strain ST1.Conclusions: BLANNOTATOR is an accurate method for bacterial protein function prediction. It is practical for genome-scale data and does not require pre-existing sequence clustering; thus, this method suits the needs of bacterial genome and metagenome researchers.

With wide applications of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), statistical comparison of serum peptide profiles and management of patients information play an important role in clinical studies, such as early diagnosis, personalized medicine and biomarker discovery. However, current available software tools mainly focused on data analysis rather than providing a flexible platform for both the management of patients information and mass spectrometry (MS) data analysis. Results. Here we presented a plug-in-based software, BioSunMS, for both the management of patients information and serum peptide profiles-based statistical analysis. By integrating all functions into a user-friendly desktop application, BioSunMS provided a comprehensive solution for clinical researchers without any knowledge in programming, as well as a plug-in architecture platform with the possibility for developers to add or modify functions without need to recompile the entire application.

Within the LCCC approach applied to biopolymers (BioLCCC), the specific retention time corresponds to a particular sequence. In combination with mass spectrometry, this approach provides an efficient tool to solve problems wherein the protein sequencing is essential. In this work, we present a theoretical background of the BioLCCC concept and demonstrate experimentally its feasibility for sequence-dependent LC retention time prediction for peptides. BioLCCC model is based on three notions: (a) a random walk model for a macromolecule chain; (b) an entropy and energy compensation for the macromolecules within the adsorbent pore; and (c) a set of phenomenological parameters for the effective interaction energies of interactions between the amino acid residues and the adsorbent surface. In this work, the phenomenological parameters have been obtained for C18 reversed-phase HPLC. Note, that contrary to alternative additive models for retention time prediction based on summation of the so-called \"retention coefficients\", the BioLCCC approach takes into account the location of amino acids within the primary structure of a peptide and, thus, allows the identification of the peptides having the same composition of amino acids but differing by their arrangement. As a result, this new approach allows prediction of retention time for any possible amino acid sequence in particular HPLC experiments. In addition, the BioLCCC model lacks of main drawbacks of additive approaches that predict retention time for sequences of limited chain lengths and provide information about amino acid composition only. The proposed BioLCCC approach was characterized experimentally using LTQ FT LC-MS and LC-MS/MS data obtained earlier for Escherichia coli. The HPLC system calibration was performed using peptide retention standards. The results received show a linear correlation between predicted and experimental retention times, with a correlation coefficient, R2, of 0.97 for a peptide standard mixture and 0.9 for E. coli data, respectively, with the standard error below 1 min.

Especially those peptides that do not have strong homology to previously identified peptides can easily be overlooked. Extensive use of BAGEL2 and user feedback has led us to develop BAGEL3. BAGEL3 features genome mining of prokaryotes, which is largely independent of open reading frame (ORF) predictions and has been extended to cover more (novel) classes of posttranslationally modified peptides. BAGEL3 uses an identification approach that combines direct mining for the gene and indirect mining via context genes. Especially for heavily modified peptides like lanthipeptides, sactipeptides, glycocins and others, this genetic context harbors valuable information that is used for mining purposes. The bacteriocin and context protein databases have been updated and it is now easy for users to submit novel bacteriocins or RiPPs.

We analyzed 679 protein spots from a reference 2-dimensional gel of cytosolic proteins of S. aureus COL by mass spectrometry resulting in 521 different proteins. 4,692 time dependent protein synthesis profiles were generated by exposing S. aureus to nine infection-related stress and starvation stimuli (H2O2, diamide, paraquat, NO, fermentation, nitrate respiration, heat shock, puromycin, mupirocin). These expression profiles are stored in an online resource called Aureolib (http://www.aureolib.de). Moreover, information on target genes of 75 regulators and regulatory elements were included in the database. Cross-comparisons of this extensive data collection of protein synthesis profiles using the tools implemented in Aureolib lead to the identification of stress and starvation specific marker proteins. Altogether, 226 protein synthesis profiles showed induction ratios of 2.5-fold or higher under at least one of the tested conditions with 157 protein synthesis profiles specifically induced in response to a single stimulus. The respective proteins might serve as marker proteins for the corresponding stimulus. By contrast, proteins whose synthesis was increased or repressed in response to more than four stimuli are rather exceptional. The only protein that was induced by six stimuli is the universal stress protein SACOL1759. Most strikingly, cluster analyses of synthesis profiles of proteins differentially synthesized under at least one condition revealed only in rare cases a grouping that correlated with known regulon structures. The most prominent examples are the GapR, Rex, and CtsR regulon. In contrast, protein synthesis profiles of proteins belonging to the CodY and σB regulon are widely distributed. In summary, Aureolib is by far the most comprehensive protein expression database for S. aureus and provides an essential tool to decipher more complex adaptation processes in S. aureus during host pathogen interaction. © 2013 Fuchs et al.","title":"Aureolib - A Proteome Signature Library: Towards an Understanding of Staphylococcus aureus Pathophysiology","authors":[{"name":"Fuchs S."},{"name":"Zuhlke D."},{"name":"Pane-Farre J."},{"name":"Kusch H."},{"name":"Wolf C."},{"name":"Reiss S."},{"name":"Binh L.T.N."},{"name":"Albrecht D."},{"name":"Riedel K."},{"name":"Hecker M."},{"name":"Engelmann S."}]},"pmid":"23967085","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC3742771","version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0070669"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data handling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"info@aureolib.de","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"aotamendi.1","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.aureolib.de/index.php?page=about"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2"],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:aureolib","biotoolsID":"aureolib","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:11:48Z","name":"Aureolib","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Gene expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0203"},{"term":"Pathology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0634"}],"additionDate":"2018-05-29T11:05:57Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.aureolib.de/index.php"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A highly accurate subcellular localization prediction tool for annotating the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":46,"date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Plant Physiology","abstract":"A complete map of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) proteome is clearly a major goal for the plant research community in terms of determining the function and regulation of each encoded protein. Developing genome-wide prediction tools such as for localizing gene products at the subcellular level will substantially advance Arabidopsis gene annotation. To this end, we performed a comprehensive study in Arabidopsis and created an integrative support vector machine-based localization predictor called AtSubP (for Arabidopsis subcellular localization predictor) that is based on the combinatorial presence of diverse protein features, such as its amino acid composition, sequence-order effects, terminal information, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix, and similarity search-based Position-Specific Iterated-Basic Local Alignment Search Tool information. When used to predict seven subcellular compartments through a 5-fold cross-validation test, our hybrid-based best classifier achieved an overall sensitivity of 91% with high-confidence precision and Matthews correlation coefficient values of 90.9% and 0.89, respectively. Benchmarking AtSubP on two independent data sets, one from Swiss-Prot and another containing green fluorescent protein- and mass spectrometry-determined proteins, showed a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of species-specific AtSubP over some widely used \"general\" tools such as TargetP, LOCtree, PA-SUB, MultiLoc, WoLF PSORT, Plant-PLoc, and our newly created All-Plant method. Cross-comparison of AtSubP on six nontrained eukaryotic organisms (rice [Oryza sativa], soybean [Glycine max], human [Homo sapiens], yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae], fruit fly [Drosophila melanogaster], and worm [Caenorhabditis elegans]) revealed inferior predictions. AtSubP significantly outperformed all the prediction tools being currently used for Arabidopsis proteome annotation and, therefore, may serve as a better complement for the plant research community.

With improvements in experimental techniques and progress in research, the overall protein interaction network frameworks of several model organisms have been created through data collection and integration. However, most of the networks processed only show simple relationships without boundary, weight or direction, which do not truly reflect the biological reality. In vivo, different types of protein interactions, such as the assembly of protein complexes or phosphorylation, often have their specific functions and qualifications. Ignorance of these features will bring much bias to the network analysis and application. Therefore, we annotate the Arabidopsis proteins in the AtPID database with further information (e.g. functional annotation, subcellular localization, tissue-specific expression, phosphorylation information, SNP phenotype and mutant phenotype, etc.) and interaction qualifications (e.g. transcriptional regulation, complex assembly, functional collaboration, etc.) via further literature text mining and integration of other resources. Meanwhile, the related information is vividly displayed to users through a comprehensive and newly developed display and analytical tools. The system allows the construction of tissue-specific interaction networks with display of canonical pathways.

To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values.

Explicit determination and description of structural units is more complicated for β-sheets than for α-helixes due to β-sheets variability both in composition and geometry.

It has been shown that the ability to form these fibrils is coded by the amino acid sequence. Existing methods for the prediction of amyloidogenicity generate an unsatisfactory high number of false positives when tested against sequences of the disease-related proteins. Methods: Recently, it has been shown that the three-dimensional structure of a majority of disease-related amyloid fibrils contains a β-strand-loop-β-strand motif called β-arch. Using this information, we have developed a novel bioinformatics approach for the prediction of amyloidogenicity. Results: The benchmark results show the superior performance of our method over the existing programs. Conclusions: As genome sequencing becomes more affordable, our method provides an opportunity to create individual risk profiles for the neurodegenerative, age-related, and other diseases ushering in an era of personalized medicine. It will also be used in the large-scale analysis of proteomes to find new amyloidogenic proteins.","title":"A structure-based approach to predict predisposition to amyloidosis","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.B."},{"name":"Znassi N."},{"name":"Chateau M.-T."},{"name":"Kajava A.V."}]},"pmid":"25150734","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"},{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Andrey V.

APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47% in E. coli) is explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally distributed about ∼5,600 (∼540 in E. coli) protein molecules/mRNA. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with >70% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.","title":"Absolute protein expression profiling estimates the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation","authors":[{"name":"Lu P."},{"name":"Vogel C."},{"name":"Wang R."},{"name":"Yao X."},{"name":"Marcotte E.M."}]},"pmid":null,"type":["Primary"],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nbt1270"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein quantitation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"}]},{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.marcottelab.org/","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":["1.1.0"],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:apex","biotoolsID":"apex","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:11:08Z","name":"APEX","topic":[{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Protein expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0108"}],"additionDate":"2017-12-18T00:03:16Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://sourceforge.net/projects/apexqpt/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/apecs-intensity-based-peptide-selection.html"}],"description":"Proteomics method for intensity-based precursor ion selection, using a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument, from a complex sample separated by 2D-LC.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":3,"date":"2010-11-05T00:00:00Z","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"LC-MALDI provides an often overlooked opportunity to exploit the separation between LC-MS and MS/MS stages of a 2D-LC-MS-based proteomics experiment, that is, by making a smarter selection for precursor fragmentation. Apex Peptide Elution Chain Selection (APECS) is a simple and powerful method for intensity-based peptide selection in a complex sample separated by 2D-LC, using a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. It removes the peptide redundancy present in the adjacent first-dimension (typically strong cation exchange, SCX) fractions by constructing peptide elution profiles that link the precursor ions of the same peptide across SCX fractions. Subsequently, the precursor ion most likely to fragment successfully in a given profile is selected for fragmentation analysis, selecting on precursor intensity and absence of adjacent ions that may cofragment. To make the method independent of experiment-specific tolerance criteria, we introduce the concept of the branching factor, which measures the likelihood of false clustering of precursor ions based on past experiments. By validation with a complex proteome sample of Arabidopsis thaliana, APECS identified an equivalent number of peptides as a conventional data-dependent acquisition method but with a 35% smaller work load. Consequently, reduced sample depletion allowed further selection of lower signal-to-noise ratio precursor ions, leading to a larger number of identified unique peptides. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","title":"Apex peptide elution chain selection: A new strategy for selecting precursors in 2D-LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF experiments on complex biological samples","authors":[{"name":"Gandhi T."},{"name":"Fusetti F."},{"name":"Wiederhold E."},{"name":"Breitling R."},{"name":"Poolman B."},{"name":"Permentier H.P."}]},"pmid":"20836568","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Modelling and simulation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"},{"term":"Mass spectra calibration","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3627"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"http://www.nbic.nl","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://trac.nbic.nl/apecs/wiki#no1"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:apecs","biotoolsID":"apecs","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:11:05Z","name":"APECS","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Simulation experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3524"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:35:51Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://trac.nbic.nl/apecs/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Functions to estimate a bipartite graph of protein complex membership using AP-MS data.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/apComplex_2.40.0.tar.gz"}],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":63,"date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Motivation: Systems biology requires accurate models of protein complexes, including physical interactions that assemble and regulate these molecular machines.

Amyloidoses are a group of usually fatal diseases, probably caused by protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation into amyloid fibrillar deposits. The mechanisms involved in amyloid fibril formation are largely unknown and are the subject of current, intensive research. In an attempt to identify possible amyloidogenic regions in proteins for further experimental investigation, we have developed and present here a publicly available online tool that utilizes five different and independently published methods, to form a consensus prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins, using only protein primary structure data. Results. It appears that the consensus prediction tool is slightly more objective than individual prediction methods alone and suggests several previously not identified amino acid stretches as potential amyloidogenic determinants, which (although several of them may be overpredictions) require further experimental studies. The tool is available at: http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/AMYLPRED. Utilizing molecular graphics programs, like O and PyMOL, as well as the algorithm DSSP, it was found that nearly all experimentally verified amyloidogenic determinants (short peptide stretches favouring aggregation and subsequent amyloid formation), and several predicted, with the aid of the tool AMYLPRED, but not experimentally verified amyloidogenic determinants, are located on the surface of the relevant amyloidogenic proteins. This finding may be important in efforts directed towards inhibiting amyloid fibril formation. Conclusion. The most significant result of this work is the observation that virtually all, to date, experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants and the majority of predicted, but not yet experimentally verified short amyloidogenic stretches, lie 'exposed' on the surface of the relevant amyloidogenic proteins, and also several of them have the ability to act as conformational 'switches'.

Automatic segmentation of such maps according to patterns of co-expression of individual molecules can be used for discovery of novel molecular signatures (molecules that are specifically expressed in particular spatial regions). However, current segmentation techniques are biased toward the discovery of higher abundance molecules and large segments; they allow limited opportunity for user interaction, and validation is usually performed by similarity to known anatomical features. We describe here a novel method, AMASS (Algorithm for MSI Analysis by Semi-supervised Segmentation). AMASS relies on the discriminating power of a molecular signal instead of its intensity as a key feature, uses an internal consistency measure for validation, and allows significant user interaction and supervision as options. An automated segmentation of entire leech embryo data images resulted in segmentation domains congruent with many known organs, including heart, CNS ganglia, nephridia, nephridiopores, and lateral and ventral regions, each with a distinct molecular signature. Likewise, segmentation of a rat brain MSI slice data set yielded known brain features and provided interesting examples of co-expression between distinct brain regions. AMASS represents a new approach for the discovery of peptide masses with distinct spatial features of expression.

We have also used multiple sequence alignment obtained from PSIBLAST and secondary structure information predicted by PSIPRED. The training and testing of all methods has been performed on a data set of 193 non-homologous protein X-ray structures using five-fold cross-validation. It has been observed that ANN with multiple sequence alignment and predicted secondary structure information outperforms other methods. Based on our observations we have developed an ANN-based method for predicting α-turns in proteins. The main components of the method are two feed-forward back-propagation networks with a single hidden layer. The first sequence-structure network is trained with the multiple sequence alignment in the form of PSI-BLAST-generated position specific scoring matrices. The initial predictions obtained from the first network and PSIPRED predicted secondary structure are used as input to the second structure-structure network to refine the predictions obtained from the first net.

Despite the great interest in the development of allosteric drugs as a new tactic in drug discovery, the understanding of the ligand-protein interactions underlying allosteric binding represents a key challenge. Herein, we introduce Alloscore, a web server that predicts the binding affinities of allosteric ligand-protein interactions. This method exhibits prominent performance in describing allosteric binding and could be useful in allosteric virtual screening and the structural optimization of allosteric agonists/antagonists.

Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the de novo sequencing of existing software. © 2010 Imperial College Press.","title":"Adepts: Advanced peptide de novo sequencing with a pair of tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"He L."},{"name":"Ma B."}]},"pmid":"21121022","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peptide identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3631"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~l22he/","email":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:adepts","biotoolsID":"adepts","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:10:24Z","name":"ADEPTS","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:35:34Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~l22he/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Web Tool for Navigating and Plotting SomaLogic ADAT Files.","language":["R","JavaScript"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":"29951204","type":[],"pmcid":"PMC6017986","version":null,"doi":"10.5334/jors.166"}],"function":[{"output":[],"note":null,"input":[],"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Principal component plotting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2939"},{"term":"Gene expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}]}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Foo Cheung","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"url":null,"email":"foo.cheung@nih.gov","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://foocheung.shinyapps.io/adat/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Web application"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:adat","biotoolsID":"adat","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:10:22Z","name":"ADAT","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Data visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092"},{"term":"Data management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3071"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-24T14:59:44Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"https://foocheung.shinyapps.io/adat/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/abcpred-artificial-neural-network-based-b-cell-epitope-prediction-server.html"}],"description":"Server to predict linear B cell epitope regions in an antigen sequence, using an artificial neural network.

Experimental methods used for characterizing epitopes are time consuming and demand large resources. The availability of epitope prediction method(s) can rapidly aid experimenters in simplifying this problem. The standard feed-forward (FNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been used in this study for predicting B-cell epitopes in an antigenic sequence. The networks have been trained and tested on a clean data set, which consists of 700 non-redundant B-cell epitopes obtained from Bcipep database and equal number of non-epitopes obtained randomly from Swiss-Prot database. The networks have been trained and tested at different input window length and hidden units. Maximum accuracy has been obtained using recurrent neural network (Jordan network) with a single hidden layer of 35 hidden units for window length of 16. The final network yields an overall prediction accuracy of 65.93% when tested by five-fold cross-validation. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction values are 67.14, 64.71, and 65.61%, respectively. It has been observed that RNN (JE) was more successful than FNN in the prediction of B-cell epitopes. The length of the peptide is also important in the prediction of B-cell epitopes from antigenic sequences.

Thus, it is challenging for users to perform such analyses, highlighting the need for a single tool for such purposes. The 3Omics one-click web tool was developed to visualize and rapidly integrate multiple human inter- or intra-transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data by combining five commonly used analyses: correlation networking, coexpression, phenotyping, pathway enrichment, and GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment.Results: 3Omics generates inter-omic correlation networks to visualize relationships in data with respect to time or experimental conditions for all transcripts, proteins and metabolites. If only two of three omics datasets are input, then 3Omics supplements the missing transcript, protein or metabolite information related to the input data by text-mining the PubMed database. 3Omics' coexpression analysis assists in revealing functions shared among different omics datasets. 3Omics' phenotype analysis integrates Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with available transcript or protein data. Pathway enrichment analysis on metabolomics data by 3Omics reveals enriched pathways in the KEGG/HumanCyc database. 3Omics performs statistical Gene Ontology-based functional enrichment analyses to display significantly overrepresented GO terms in transcriptomic experiments. Although the principal application of 3Omics is the integration of multiple omics datasets, it is also capable of analyzing individual omics datasets. The information obtained from the analyses of 3Omics in Case Studies 1 and 2 are also in accordance with comprehensive findings in the literature.Conclusions: 3Omics incorporates the advantages and functionality of existing software into a single platform, thereby simplifying data analysis and enabling the user to perform a one-click integrated analysis.

Although the principle of the method can be applied to detect similarities to a single protein surface, the possibility of extending this approach to protein families displaying common structural and/or functional properties, makes it a more powerful tool. In analogy to profiles derived from the multiple alignment of protein sequences, we derive a 3D surface profile from a protein structure or from a multiple structure alignment of several proteins. The 3D profile is used to screen the protein structure database, searching for similar protein surfaces. The application of the procedure to SH2 and SH3 binding pockets and to the nucleotide binding pocket associated with the p-loop structural motif is described. The SH2 and SH3 3D profiles can identify all the SH2 and SH3 binding regions present in the test dataset; the p-loop 3D profile is able to recognize all the p-loop-containing proteins present in the test dataset. Analysis of the p-loop 3D profile allowed the identification of a positive charge whose position is conserved in space but not in sequence.

A large number of PROSITE patterns select false positives and/or miss known true positives. It is possible that - at least in some cases - the weak specificity and/or sensitivity of a pattern is due to the fact that one, or maybe more, functional and/or structural key residues are not represented in the pattern. Multiple sequence alignments are commonly used to build functional sequence patterns. If residues structurally conserved in proteins sharing a function cannot be aligned in a multiple sequence alignment, they are likely to be missed in a standard pattern construction procedure. Results. Here we present a new procedure aimed at improving the sensitivity and/ or specificity of poorly-performing patterns. The procedure can be summarised as follows: 1. residues structurally conserved in different proteins, that are true positives for a pattern, are identified by means of a computational technique and by visual inspection. 2. the sequence positions of the structurally conserved residues falling outside the pattern are used to build extended sequence patterns. 3. the extended patterns are optimised on the SWISS-PROT database for their sensitivity and specificity. The method was applied to eight PROSITE patterns. Whenever structurally conserved residues are found in the surface region close to the pattern (seven out of eight cases), the addition of information inferred from structural analysis is shown to improve pattern selectivity and in some cases selectivity and sensitivity as well. In some of the cases considered the procedure allowed the identification of functionally interesting residues, whose biological role is also discussed. Conclusion. Our method can be applied to any type of functional motif or pattern (not only PROSITE ones) which is not able to select all and only the true positive hits and for which at least two true positive structures are available. The computational technique for the identification of structurally conserved residues is already available on request and will be soon accessible on our web server. The procedure is intended for the use of pattern database curators and of scientists interested in a specific protein family for which no specific or selective patterns are yet available. © 2004 Via and Helmer-Citterich, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"A structural study for the optimisation of functional motifs encoded in protein sequences","authors":[{"name":"Via A."},{"name":"Helmer-Citterich M."}]},"pmid":"15119965","type":[],"pmcid":null,"version":null,"doi":null},{"note":null,"metadata":{"citationCount":45,"date":"2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"Background: The identification of local similarities between two protein structures can provide clues of a common function. Many different methods exist for searching for similar subsets of residues in proteins of known structure. However, the lack of functional and structural information on single residues, together with the low level of integration of this information in comparison methods, is a limitation that prevents these methods from being fully exploited in high-throughput analyses. Results: Here we describe Query3d, a program that is both a structural DBMS (Database Management System) and a local comparison method. The method conserves a copy of all the residues of the Protein Data Bank annotated with a variety of functional and structural information. New annotations can be easily added from a variety of methods and known databases. The algorithm makes it possible to create complex queries based on the residues' function and then to compare only subsets of the selected residues. Functional information is also essential to speed up the comparison and the analysis of the results. Conclusion: With Query3d, users can easily obtain statistics on how many and which residues share certain properties in all proteins of known structure. At the same time, the method also finds their structural neighbours in the whole PDB.
