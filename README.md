# Proteomics_domain_setup
Project will setup the Proteomics domain, using the EDAM ontology to annotated the taxonomy and bio.tools for tools annotations. The domain will be setup using the set of tools (21) originally proposed in [[1]][lamprecht2019], all tools from bio.tools annotated as "proteomics" tools (>700) and all tools available in bio.tools (>17 000). Further, the prohect allows to run benchmark for each of the mentioned domains, using 4 different Proteomics Use Cases.
